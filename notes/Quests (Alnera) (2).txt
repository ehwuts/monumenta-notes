#Q114I01 https://puu.sh/GFWVn/1bdccc5af4.png

[03:45:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Blacksmith Ghalla] I don't really have much time to talk. Got a lot of orders to fill today.
[03:45:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I found this book that mentions your name.]
[03:45:16] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Blacksmith Ghalla] Where did you find that? Actually, it doesn't matter, just leave it on the counter so it doesn't get lost.
[03:45:16] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Do you know who it belongs to?]
[03:45:21] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Blacksmith Ghalla] Of course I do, it belongs to Selari. Can't you see his name etched on the spine? Anyway, he's not here right now. He left about a week ago, saying something about his research notes getting stolen. No clue when he will be back.

[03:46:17] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Little did I understand how hard it was to infuse an object with an aspect of power. The artifacts must be much more than simple sheep fur, and from that revelation, I began to invent.

[03:46:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Primeval Creations I: You found an old journal in the Alnera Archives. See if you can follow up on it. You can always find it there again if you lose it.

[03:47:21] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] ESSENCE OF THE UNIVERSE
[03:47:21] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] In order to gather that much energy into a single point, a pure tesseract is needed to hold the energy in place, one formed from the perfect alignment of all aspects of their power. When all 6 intersections of the three rings match, the power generated will be enough to collapse a small gem into the necessary crystalline structure.

[03:51:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You have no need to go into this room yet.
[03:51:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You shouldn't venture much further into the workshop just yet.

[03:59:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You make your way back down the narrow passage and end up back in Ghalla's shop.

https://puu.sh/GG7CL/d27876217f.png

[15:24:06] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] With the tesseract complete, I was able to move on and further my work. Now that an object existed that was totally untuned from all aspects of the universe, with enough pushing, it can be convinced that it aligns with a single aspect of primeval power.

#Q114I02 https://puu.sh/GG7DC/afef9c5a03.png

[20:09:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The floor falls out from below you, and you make your way through a small passageway until you find a narrow hallway.
[20:09:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] THE POWER OF SOUL
[20:09:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Of everything I have researched, the power of Soul might be the most strange. For what is a soul? Is it defined? Is it a constant? This machine attempts to answer that, and reaches deep within your soul, shaping itself to your darkest fears - that which you hoped you'd never see again, but far more painful than anything you remember. Remove all light from the soul in order to harness its true power.

[20:18:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The soul is definitely not constant, but it wishes for a state of stability. By harnessing that desire for stability, a soul can be bound to something physical - a person, an object, a place. That is the true power of the Aspect of Soul. Alas, this design was a failure, but I have learned greatly nonetheless. The power of Soul alone was not what I required, thus it was time to progress onwards.

[16:37:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Length : Short
[16:37:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Difficulty : Hard
[16:37:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Description : You found another one of Selari's journals. Journey your way back into his lab and see what you can find.

[16:54:55] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Primeval Creations II: You found another one of Selari's journals. Journey back into his workshop and see what you can find. Remember to bring some uncharged tesseracts with you.

[01:27:17] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] THE POWER OF BODY
[01:27:17] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] After Soul comes Body, the physical manifestation of everything that we are, the shell with which we interact with the world. And like the soul, all bodies are different, each harboring its own strengths and weaknesses. Through a unique formation of various creatures, one may concentrate the very power of Body itself.

[01:52:21] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] With the body comes fortitude, and through fortitude comes strength. The absolute and total control over the physical self - this is the true power of the Aspect of Body. However, this experiment was ultimately a failure. The power of Body alone was not what I required, thus it was time to progress onwards.

[01:57:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] THE POWER OF PESTILENCE
[01:57:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] And after Body comes Pestilence, the corruption that engulfs the body and shifts it away from equilibrium. All diseases carry with them a small portion of that power and, through infecting isolated creatures with exactly one disease, that power can be collected.

wither with fangilium
spider with enderpox
creeper with enderpox
spider with blazoids
creeper with creepititus
zombie with fangilium

[02:17:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Pestilence spreads relentlessly, rooting its corruption to the core of that which it has infected until it ceases to exist. That is the true power of the Aspect of Pestilence. As before though, this experiment has resulted in failure. The power of Pestilence alone is not what I require, thus it is time to progress onwards.

[03:05:29] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] THE POWER OF MAGIC
[03:05:29] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Magic, that engrossing ecstasy that fills the veins of all those who dare seek its power. The aspect that is most commonly familiar, and yet it is so vastly misunderstood. However my experience with it can guide me, and through a specific encoding of various magic properties, I believe I can concentrate it with ease.

etc

[04:28:31] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Potential, the ability the imagine and therefore be. The endless possibilities to change the world around you, to manipulate it to your liking, with only the requirement of dreaming of something bigger. This is the true power of the Aspect of Magic. However, while this experiment has proven fruitful, the power of Magic alone is not what I need. I shall continue pushing forward with my research.

[04:34:30] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] THE POWER OF THE ELEMENTS
[04:34:30] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Of all the aspects I have studied, the Elements seems to be the most vague. What is an Element? The water that brings us life? The air that fills our lungs? Are these truly the primordal powers that create life? This is the answer I wish to seek. I believe that by creating a single-width node string for each element that connects 2 designated points, where no node strings cross eachother, I can harness this power.

https://puu.sh/GKFTj/f903d3fe85.png

[04:55:31] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] A clarity has washed over me, a realization that I had not previously seen. The world is more than a collection of elements, together they form more than the sum of their parts. They wrap and connect, and it the manipulation of this connection that forms the basis of the Aspect of the Elements. I am grateful for this experiment's informity, however the power of the Elements alone is not what I require. My research now enters a new realm.

[23:23:35] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What is your work here?]
[23:23:37] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sierhaven Smith] I'm an... archaeologist, of sorts. I explore the lands in search of secrets left by our ancestors that have been long forgotten to time: tombs of lost pharaohs, sunken temples, you get the picture. But, right now, I'm in search of the desert's greatest treasure.
[23:23:37] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Which would be what?]
[23:23:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] niwatori222 was slain by §4Masked Figure using [§b§lCalvarium]
[23:23:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sierhaven Smith] The Gem of Ishnir- a fabled diamond said to be so large that it dwarfs dunes in comparison. Myths say it was last in the possession of the Pharaoh Tehkma Ka, the second-to-last pharaoh of the Ka dynasty.
[23:23:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sierhaven Smith] Unfortunately, we have very little in the way of written records of that time- anything during that era is scarce to find information on. It's unknown why, exactly, but, for some reason, any accounts from then simply don't exist.
[23:23:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [So you don't actually know if it exists?]
[23:23:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sierhaven Smith] Technically, no, though I have a suspicion that it does; reason being that any questions on it that I ask the Pharaoh's advisors always lead to nervous sweats and short answers. Would you be interested in helping me settle this?
[23:23:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sure.]
[23:24:06] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sierhaven Smith] Fantastic! I suppose the first place for us to start is research into Tehkma Ka. If he really was the last one in possession of the Gem, following his tracks will be our best hope. I'll look over my information here- you go and speak to Nyra. She's the Royal Archivist to the Pharaoh. We have a... tangled past, so she won't speak much to me. Perhaps she'll give you some more information?

[23:24:06] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Help Sierhaven Smith in his search for the Gem of Ishnir.

[23:24:27] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Gem of Ishnir: Seek out Archivist Nyra in the Pharaoh's palace.

[23:25:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Archivist Nyra] Hello there. What brings you to the pharaoh's library today?
[23:25:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Who are you?]
[23:25:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [The pharaoh's library is open to the public?]
[23:25:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What can you tell me about Alnera?]
[23:25:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Can you tell me anything about Pharaoh Tehkma Ka?]
[23:25:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Can you tell me anything about the Gem of Ishnir?]
[23:25:27] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Archivist Nyra] Let's see what we have on him here. Okay, Tehkma Ka, second to last pharaoh of the Ka dynasty. Born 169 CCE, died at the age of 70 in 239 CCE. Was supposedly laid to rest in the pyramid Jaldeshret, colloquially known as the Dehydrated Oasis, though no tomb has ever been found to corroborate those claims. Seems like that's all the information we have on him.
[23:25:27] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [His tomb has never been found?]
[23:25:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Archivist Nyra] It's not all that surprising- this was about 600 years ago, after all. This period of time also just so happens to fall into the 200 year "blank" period in our history: the years between 53 CCE to 248 CCE. We are lucky we have as much information on him as we do.
[23:25:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Can you tell me anything about the Gem of Ishnir?]
[23:25:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Archivist Nyra] What, are you another treasure hunter? No, it doesn't exist. Don't even waste your time.
[23:25:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] It doesn't seem like she has any more information she can give you on the subject. Best report back to Sierhaven Smith.

[23:26:06] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Gem of Ishnir: Return to Sierhaven Smith with the information you learned from Nyra.

[23:29:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sierhaven Smith] Welcome back. Did you get any information out of Nyra?
[23:29:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [It seems like all she knew was where he was supposedly buried: the Dehydrated Oasis.]
[23:29:36] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> SharkTech » all right let me try it
[23:29:43] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sierhaven Smith] Jaldeshret, huh? I've been there countless times- in fact, I'm the one who uncovered the entrance to the tunnels underneath the pyramid. I've never seen signs that there is a tomb anywhere in there, though.
[23:29:43] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Perhaps I should go see if you missed anything?]
[23:29:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sierhaven Smith] A fair idea- some fresh eyes are never a bad thing. Leave no stone unpressed! While you're gone, I'm going to pull out my notes from that expedition, and see if there was anything I had logged but didn't take to relevance.

[23:30:06] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Gem of Ishnir: Enter the Dehydrated Oasis and search out clues for Tehkma Ka's tomb. Leave no stone unpressed.

[23:45:31] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You hear whispers faintly calling out to you, begging for you to release them. 'Leap into the lowest lava pool in the tunnels below, and pray your soul is guided.'

[00:01:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Tehkma Ka] You fool... What have you done...?
[00:02:03] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] A mysterious force kicks you out of the tomb, and you find yourself back outside the pyramid.

[00:02:16] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Gem of Ishnir: You stumbled on the tomb of Tehkma Ka. Report this back to Sierhaven Smith.

[00:05:10] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sierhaven Smith] That was a quick trip. Find anything of note?
[00:05:10] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I found the tomb of Tehkma Ka.]
[00:05:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sierhaven Smith] Really now?! What did you find?
[00:05:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Tehkma Ka's journal and a locking device.]
[00:05:16] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sierhaven Smith] Mind if I see the book?
[00:05:16] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You hand Siery the book, and he reads through the pages slowly.
[00:05:16] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sierhaven Smith] I can't believe it! He actually mentions the Gem in here! The locking mechanism you mentioned, I assume this is the "key" he references. I assume you managed to get past it; what was it like?
[00:05:16] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [It looked like a stylized ankh, but something really bad seemed to happen when I activated it.]
[00:05:27] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sierhaven Smith] A stylized ankh? Wait... do you mean the symbol of the Lost Sands? What a fantastic lead, Sukie! It's time we head there then! I'll start packing my things- I'm coming with you this time!
[00:05:27] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Were you listening? I really don't think this is a good idea.]
[00:05:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sierhaven Smith] Oh, don't chicken out on me now! The discovery of a lifetime awaits us! You go on ahead over to the Lost Sands ruins. I'll meet you there.

[00:05:38] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Gem of Ishnir: Meet Sierhaven Smith over in the Lost Sands City ruins.

[00:13:44] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Siery] Over here! This is the entrance to the underground. If we are to find anything, it will be here.

[00:14:45] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Gem of Ishnir: Enter the Lost Sands City undergrounds.

[23:20:36] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sierhaven Smith] I... I don't believe it. Is this... a city? The tales of the Gem, they must have been warped over time. How incredible: an entire city, lost to time, and right under our noses! I can't thank you enough for your help, Sukie- Please accept my deepest gratitude!

[17:36:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hopefully things get better for you.]
[17:37:11] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Guard Myra] I am from the nearby town of Molta. I worked there as a guard for several years without problems. Then, I learned that there was a position open here in Alnera. I jumped at the chance to move to the city, but when I got here I learned I had a fear of heights.
[17:37:11] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Is there anything I can do to help you?]
[17:37:11] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sadly that isn't something I can really help with.]

[17:37:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Guard Myra] You want to help me? Well I suppose there is one way... If I had the feather of a Ponike I could use the supplies I have on hand to create a pair of boots able to cushion myself from any unfortunate falls. They tend to nest at the top of the Cinders Roost. Their feathers are super light, so you shouldn't have trouble carrying them. I would go myself, but, you know- heights.
[17:37:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I will set out as soon as I can.]
[17:37:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [That seems a bit too dangerous for me.]

As you approach the summit you notice a Ponike, and it notices you. You are going to have to defeat it to get a feather.

As the bird falls in battle you pluck a feather from its body. Somehow it is lighter than a feather and also takes up almost no room.

[17:48:21] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I found one, but decided not to give it to you yet.]

[18:04:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Zulamar] Good. You don't ask troublesome questions like the others, and you don't back down either.
[18:04:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [...]
[18:04:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wait! I changed my mind... I think I'll refrain from your offer.]
[18:04:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Zulamar] Well, let's get to the point.
[18:04:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Zulamar] According to ancient legends, there used to be a prosperous empire with a king that was very greedy for knowledge. The only legacy left of this empire are ruins, proudly towering over the ocean.
[18:04:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Zulamar] All kingdoms have their secrets, and the Viridian Empire was no exception. Ancient texts say that King Salazar had two cursed artifacts, yet he was afraid to use them.
[18:04:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Afraid? Why?]
[18:04:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sounds like a fairy-tale. Wait, are you trying to make a fool of me?]
[18:04:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> DDeine » So in theory I could access every single dungeon rn?
[18:04:30] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Zulamar] That's none of your concern right now. But, I might tell you once you've helped me.
[18:04:30] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Zulamar] I digress. As it turns out, one of those artifacts is hidden deep underground, under the Sunken Tomb to the northwest. I don't know what dangers lie within, but be careful! Once you're inside, seek out a hidden door; it should open up to a secret chamber that holds great treasure. Good luck!

[18:25:01] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] As you move inside the temple, you notice a large eye looking directly at you
[18:25:01] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] A magical barrier blocks your way. Perhaps you should examine this room?

[19:38:18] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Treasure of the Past [2/2]: If you lose the artifact you can get it back from the hidden chamber.

[19:42:05] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Zulamar] You got it? Well, show it to me, quickly!
[19:42:05] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] He seems both a little bit nervous and excited at the same time.
[19:42:05] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I have it right here.]
[19:42:05] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [In a hurry? You look nervous...]
[19:42:09] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Zulamar] Huh? What? Why does it bother you so much?
[19:42:09] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] He looks away from you and tries to examine the artifact.
[19:42:09] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [You send me after a relic you aren't sure exists, refuse to tell me about yourself, and now you try to ignore me. I need answers.]
[19:42:16] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Zulamar] FINE! Fine! Calm down! I'll tell you what you want to know, just- calm down.
[19:42:16] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Zulamar] The artifact you retrieved from the sunken tomb is not a simple relic of the past, but is instead a part of a mechanism that can be used to restore the Viridian Empire to its former glory. I can't tell you the details- I'm not sure of them myself- but my employer will surely be able to answer your questions. He should be in Frostgate. His name is Zeroc- I'll let him know you helped me here. Now, where was I...
[19:42:16] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I see. Let's talk about my reward now...]
[19:42:36] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Zulamar] Ah, yes! Reward, indeed... You see, I have nothing but these shiny crystals- er, crystalline shards...
[19:42:36] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] He frowns a bit and thinks for a second.
[19:42:36] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Zulamar] Although... I can make a replica of this spear and imbue it with either the power of lightning, fire, or ice- whichever one you want. But choose wisely- once you pick one, there is no going back.

[19:54:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Amina] Safar, my right-hand man, informed me of an adventurer who has helped the Trade a great deal. Tell me, is that you?
[19:54:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Yes, and here is the Amulet to prove it.]
[19:54:17] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] She looks at the amulet in acknowledgement.
[19:54:17] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Amina] Hmm... so it seems you are. I believe a greeting is in order then. My name is Amina, and I am the head of the Ishnir Trade. You, Sukie, have shown the Trade your loyalty.
[19:54:17] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [So why did you want to see me?]
[19:54:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Amina] You see, a rather perplexing issue has recently emerged. Many of our outposts among the Trade Route have fallen silent- one of the larger and more important outposts being the Crystal Haven.
[19:54:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Amina] If we were to lose contact for a prolonged period of time, the Ishnir Trade would have a much harder time moving valuables between cities.
[19:54:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [So I should check that out?]
[19:54:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [That sounds like a real issue... but I have something else to do.]

[20:54:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Yeah, I saw that. They seem to be overunning the upper levels...]
[20:54:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hassan] I had to hide in the vault- luckily, they were too stupid to figure out the locking mechanism... Wait- oh no, I think they're coming back!

[20:56:38] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hassan] I'll be fine, just go!

[20:57:09] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] A Lost Cause: Warn Amina of what has happened at the Crystal Haven.

[21:04:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Amina] So? Have you scouted out the outpost?
[21:04:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Yes. Most of the men stationed there were killed... Hassan was the only survivor.]
[21:04:38] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Amina] What?! How could this be? What happened?
[21:04:38] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Raiders took over the outpost. They nearly killed Hassan too!]
[21:04:40] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Amina] Oh, this is awful, just awful! You need to warn Riaz about this. He controls the base of operations for Rahkeri- hopefully he can come up with a plan to help.

[21:04:46] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] A Lost Cause: Travel to Rahkeri to meet Riaz to tell him about the situation.

[21:14:27] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Riaz] Hello again, Sukie! How are you doing?
[21:14:27] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Amina sent me. The Trade's outpost in Crystal Haven has been overrun with raiders.]
[21:14:35] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Riaz] What?! How could this be? The Trade Route was always a secure means of travelling...
[21:14:35] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [She's asking you for a plan. Got any ideas?]
[21:14:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Riaz] Well, we'd probably need to scout out a new location to build an outpost... However, to do so, we should ask for help in one of our other outposts, namely the Warehouse Compound. Have a look around there for mapping supplies.

[21:14:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] A Lost Cause [1/2]: Seek mapping supplies from the Warehouse Compound.
[21:14:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] A Lost Cause [2/2]: Return to Riaz once you have found them.

#Q129I01

[21:26:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Riaz] Did you find any maps?
[21:26:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Yes, but the camp was also overrun with raiders... I was lucky I even got these.]
[21:26:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Riaz] What? The warehouse, too? This can't be true!
[21:26:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] He looks at you in disbelief.
[21:26:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What should we do next?]
[21:26:54] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Riaz] Thankfully, the maps you've retrieved are usable; I'll let Amina know when I've scouted out a location. You should go tell her about the warehouse though... I doubt she'll be pleased.

[21:26:58] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] A Lost Cause: Let Amina know that the Warehouse Compound was also overrun...

[21:27:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Amina] So has Riaz devised a solution?
[21:27:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Yes, I've helped him retrieve some mapping supplies from the warehouse, but...]
[21:28:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Amina] But? What's the but?
[21:28:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [It was overrun, too...]
[21:28:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Amina] By Ishnir, are you serious? How could this happen? The Trade seems to be falling apart...
[21:28:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] She looks completely distressed.
[21:28:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Maybe I could help you guys reclaim what's yours?]
[21:28:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Amina] Hmm, now that's an idea. The raiders are powerful though... Traveling to the Bandit Hideaway Hill on the Trade Route and stealing some of their food reserves might slow them down enough for us to take over again! Don't worry about getting all of it, about ten should be enough. Don't want them to starve to death, that would make us no better than them.

[21:28:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] A Lost Cause [1/2]: Raid the Bandit Hideaway Hill for their food rations. (You need 10 food supplies).
[21:28:27] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] A Lost Cause [2/2]: Return to Amina with the raider's food reserves.

[22:04:25] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Amina] Perfect! That looks like quite a bit of their food- let's see how well they raid without anything to eat.
[22:04:25] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hopefully that helps the Trade out! Should give you guys a window of opportunity to recover.]
[22:04:30] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Amina] It might, it might not. No way of telling really... The Ishnir Trade has suffered a great deal today. Thankfully, with your help, the pain has been somewhat remedied.

[22:05:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Could I ask you some questions again?]
[22:05:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [That's good to hear! Say... Mind if I check it out?]
[22:05:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Amina] I don't see why not! You've helped us a great deal. The entrance is quite hidden, but it lies in the stretch of desert between the Terracotta Mining Town and the Lost Sands City. I hope to see you there soon.

[21:53:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] THE POWER OF KNOWLEDGE
[21:53:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Knowledge is a power that interests me greatly, for its use forged the very foundations of Viridia. What could this power imply, aside from the information one simply has learned? I feel as though this power will be difficult to manifest, though through similar methods I applied with my last experiment, I feel it might be possible.

[21:55:44] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] In one chest lies the power to attune a vessel to Knowledge. 
[21:55:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] It does not appear that this was the right chest.

then count ltr to that number

[21:59:44] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The ability to see the world for its deeper intricacies, and the wisdom needed to understand those connections, this is the power provided by the Aspect of Knowledge. While this power is not suited well for my path on its own, I highly anticipate it to play a pivotal role.

[22:01:54] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] THE POWER OF BALANCE
[22:01:54] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Balance is likely the most abstract power I've come across so far in my studies. The texts lead me to believe it is something more akin to spiritual balance, rather than physical. I believe if I take creatures that are naturally very unbalanced, and force them into a balanced state, perhaps I can generate the power I seek.

[22:11:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] I believe I've made sense of it. The harmony that keeps all things in order, and the dissonance which thrives to tear that order apart - these two powers are bound together by an intangible thread, the natural balance of the universe. This is the true power of the Aspect of Balance. Now, I hold the power to balance forces which seek to tear eachother apart, and the knowledge required to keep that balance. This has truly been quite the sucessful endeavour.

[22:37:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Death... The looming inevitability that threatens all who dwell in the world. I know its effects far too well. That said, what power can death itself generate? Does more death produce a higher energy output? The fact that I must ask these questions bothers me greatly, but I believe if I can direct a beam of energy into a block of obsidian, I can generate the answers I require.

[22:38:53] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You cannot merge the beams yet as you have not yet positioned the second beam!

[22:49:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] My knees buckle slightly at the thought of what I just did, killing a man for my own research and advantage. Would the old me have done that? In my heart, I do not know, but in my mind, I see the bigger significance. The ability to sever metaphysical connections and retool them to your whim - this is true power of the Aspect of Death. How astonishing...

[22:50:07] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] THE POWER OF LIGHT
[22:50:07] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] In contrast to a power like Balance, the power of Light is the very definition of visualizable. It is something we interact with daily, for if we did not, we could never see the path ahead of us. By compressing light and dispersing it, I believe I can form the power I need with relative ease.

No, what lies here is the ability to see further than that - the ability to look beyond what is physical, to pierce into the darkness of fate itself. This is the true power of the Aspect of Light. I must admit, I've not felt as if I was this close to an answer in a very long time...

[23:24:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] When I ponder on the Aspect of Memory, I am filled with a dread that for some reason feels familiar. What is Memory? And can it take physical form? I have developed a method for condensing physical memory into packets, a sequence that represents something larger. If I use this method, and sequence enough power to create that Crimson that eluded me, perhaps that shall be the key.

[23:27:01] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Suddenly, I became overwhelmed with a memory from a time long passed. From a time before this.
[23:27:06] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] It was time I confronted him. I had been preparing to take my leave, but bringing myself to do it was the hardest part, after everything he had been through.

[23:27:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Selari] I'm aware that this will be a tough time for you both, but I know you can handle it. You're my friend Vargos, and it hurts me to do this, but I have a goal I must accomplish. I cannot allow anything to distract my work, not if we are ever going to stop him.
[23:27:31] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Vargos] What are you planning on doing?

[23:28:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] I didn't realize at the time, but it would be the last time I would see my friend. Maybe one day I can face him again... when this is all over...
[23:28:29] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] This machine has been a mistake. My memories now leak from the depths of my consciousness, and infuse with the walls around them. I hear the echos of my thoughts from previous experiments. What a horrid reality, for this was not a power meant to be held by man.

[20:29:44] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] THE POWER OF MIND
[20:29:44] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Mind... A power one would assume is related to Knowledge, yet its applications do not lie in simply wisdom. Mind is the inherent root of reason, and without reason, one would simply lose their sanity. This machine must push the limits that reason in order to truly concentrate this power...

[20:30:30] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] - Position changes can only be made in L-shaped movements. That is, in movements of 2x1 or 1x2.
[20:30:30] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] - The loser of a round is determined when a move can no longer be made. If you are trapped and cannot progress, you have lost.
[20:30:30] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] - You must defeat me in this game 3 consecutive times. Only then will the power of Mind be unlocked.

[20:53:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] I was incorrect, reason is not the underlying nature of Mind, but merely a part. The ability to clearly perceive the world, the true nature of all things around you, and the reason by which to put that understanding into perspective - that is the true power of the Aspect of Mind. However, it is an unstable power, difficult to control. It's usefulness is yet to be seen.

[20:55:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Another aspect that seemingly draws from human nature, though Emotion would not have been a power I would have expected previously. I was hoping that I would be able to continue on without more test subjects, but it seems I will need them. I must create a way to force emotion upon them...

[20:55:46] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Caged Citizen] I... I don't know! I went to sleep one night, and when I woke up, I was here. There was this strange man, as well. Kept mumbling something about emotions. Proper creep.

[00:36:53] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Caged Citizen] Not really, it seemed liked that guy was pretty much done with it, so I've never seen it used... OH, I do remember him saying something though... It was a number... What was it... 102? Yeah that sounds right. Maybe that means something?

[20:56:21] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Two vessels for energy exist in this room - one can hold 5 units, 
[20:56:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] the other, 3 units. In order to properly send energy to the 
[20:56:23] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] subject, exactly 4 units of power must be transfered. 
[20:56:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] However, the smaller vessel is unable to submit power to 
[20:56:25] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] the subject, so all 4 units must come from the lager vessel. 
[20:56:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] 5 chages of power exist within the system for consumption. 

[22:52:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] I understand it now, 'emotion' is simply a poetic term. The ability to take that which lies within, that which is intangeble, and bring it to the surface, manifested into our realm of existance. That is the true power of the Aspect of Emotion. Only one more power now lies ahead of me...

[00:29:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] THE POWER OF TIME
[00:29:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] This is it, my final experiement in this laboratory. All of my research in the Isles has led to this point. Time is a power we all know far too well, the aspect of the universe that eventually claims us all. To harness its energy, I must force the hands of time themselves to bend to will, but to do that, I must first find understanding.

one hand is the seconds hand, it is pointing to 12
one hand is the minutes hand, it hopefully points to an hour
one hand is the hour hand, which will lay inbetween, hopefully
enter a time they can match

[00:32:37] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Selari] Strange... It doesn't seem to have done anything... I'm sure my calculations were correct on this one...
[00:32:37] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The man does not seem to notice you.
[00:32:37] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Uh, sorry. When did you get here?]
[00:32:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The man becomes startled by your presence...
[00:32:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Selari] How are you... in my lab... 
[00:32:44] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] He looks around briefly.
[00:32:44] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Selari] Or perhaps more accurately... how will you be in my lab...
[00:32:44] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I... don't understand your question.]
[00:32:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Selari] No, of course you don't.
[00:32:54] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Selari] But to be frank, it no longer matters... My work in the Isles is complete. I have depleted this land of its knowledge on the wools.
[00:33:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Selari] The time for unification draws near... I simply need a few final pieces of the puzzle, pieces that lie beyond this land... that lie in the Architect's Ring.

[7:43 AM] [PP] quackqwack_: Explanation: You can find three numbers around the room on signs and one by talking to the captive during a solve. the four numbers are:
102
223
330
400
The first digit is to order them, and the last two tell you how many charges you need to have inthe left and right vessel respectively.  First you put 0 charges in the left vessel and 2 in the right. You press the subject button and you get a chat message.  Continue down the list and after the fourth one you get an extra charge.  With 6 charges it's possible to get 4 into the left vessel
