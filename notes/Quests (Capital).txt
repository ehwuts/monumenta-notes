[16:39:17] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Octavius] Well done indeed! Those bandits won't be harrassing anyone any more. What do you think, a stack of enchanting bottles for your trouble?

[16:39:26] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Octavius] Hah, you're smarter than you look. Yes, there's something questionably legal here, but keep your mouth shut and don't tell the guards and there's an extra stack of bottles in it for you.
[16:39:26] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Note : This decision will change future quest lines!

[16:41:36] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Captain Murano] *reads documents* That cur! We've been suspicious of Octavius for a while, but had no evidence. With this we can start building a case. I can't offer much by way of reward, but take this blade in case he sends his thugs. Thank you, and I shall tell the other guards of your honor and trustworthiness.

==Bane of the Bakers==
[13:49:00] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Stefan] You look like the kind of guy who likes pretzels. You know who makes pretzels? Me, Stefan, young pretzel maker extraordinaire.
[13:49:00] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Aren't you a bit young to be running a business?]
[13:49:00] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where are your pretzels?]
[13:49:07] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Stefan] Well, I've had a bit of an issue. The bakers stole my recipe. Don't ask me why, they're just jerks and like taking things from little kids. If you could get my recipe back I'll give you all the pretzels you can eat and more. I'm almost out of stock to sell!
[13:49:07] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'll get the recipe.]
[13:49:07] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Maybe I'll have time later.]
[13:49:17] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Stefan] Thanks! That baker will get what he deserves. You can find him over in the bazaar along the eastern path from the plaza.

[13:49:17] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Using the official Monumenta Resource Pack is highly recommended.

[14:06:54] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Head Baker] Gah! That dastardly kid must have sent you for it. No, we're not giving our recipe away, especially not to that kid. Go tell him he's out of luck.
[14:07:01] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Baker] All our breads and pastries are made fresh each day. Try some and you won't be disappointed!

[14:08:47] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Stefan] I should have guessed they wouldn't give it up that easily. We're going to have to take it ourselves.
[14:08:47] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Stefan] So here's the plan. The bakers have a large kitchen below their shop. The entrance is right behind the shop and leads down to a trap filled baking and storage area. You're going to have to go in there and hunt for the recipe and then bring it back to me. I'd be careful, you have to jump around a bunch and I'm scared of heights, which is why I haven't gone down there myself. Good luck!

[14:21:06] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Stefan] Awesome! This recipe is perfect! Here, I baked some pretzels just for you. These should keep you going for a while. Also, here's a fun little toy I use sometimes. It's really great for helping me focus and might help you too!

[21:11:41] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [So you need a healing potion?]

Her bragging got on my nerves and I haven't spoken to her since. I will have to give in and crawl over there later, it won't be a very pleasant trip.
[21:11:50] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I could go see Nurse Deidre for you.]

[21:30:22] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [What do you need?]
[21:30:27] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Nurse Deidre] I have most of the things she will need, but we are out of materials to make casts. If her leg keeps moving it will never heal, so that is rather important.

[03:07:40] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Clear as Glass: Arian doesn't seem to believe you. You should probably return to Nelfine.

[03:33:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Nelfine] Uh... hello?
[03:33:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hey Nelfine, what's with that face?]
[03:33:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Nelfine] How did you get in here?
[03:33:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [The same way I have been coming in, why?]
[03:33:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Nelfine] ...They told me nobody could ever get in here.
[03:33:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Nelfine, are you okay? It's me, Sukie.]
[03:33:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Nelfine] I'm sorry, but I never get visitors here. Every now and then, I'll hear a voice in here, proper creepy-like.
[03:33:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Something is wrong. Why do you not remember who I am?]
[03:33:30] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Nelfine] If I had to guess, it's likely because we've never met.
[03:33:30] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I need to go back to Arian. Something is really wrong here..]
[03:33:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Nelfine] Arian, you say? I don't know who that is, but there was this note lying at my feet with that name on it. Perhaps it is for him?

[03:35:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Arian] Back already? Haven't you caused me enough suffering today?
[03:35:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Arian, something is wrong. Nelfine seems to have lost her memory again.]
[03:35:37] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Arian] Another story about memory loss, eh? You could at least try to be creative.
[03:35:37] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [It looks like she wrote this for you before that happened though.]
[03:35:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Arian] Here we go again...
[03:35:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Arian takes the note
[03:35:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Arian] As clear as...
[03:35:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Arian looks at you befuddled
[03:35:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Arian] How do you know this sign off line?
[03:35:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [It's because I didn't write that, Nelfine did.]
[03:35:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Arian] But...
[03:35:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [She really is alive Arian. She just can't remember anything.]
[03:35:50] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Arian] How did she remember enough to write me a letter then?
[03:35:50] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I restored her memory with a device I found. It seems the effects were only temporary.]
[03:35:54] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Arian] Well then. Go use that device again. Restore her memory again, and then bring me to her.

[03:36:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Clear as Glass: Find your way back to the Overgrown Laboratory and see if you can restore Nelfine's memories once again.

[03:44:04] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Clear as Glass: The old lab has been destroyed! Follow the clues in the strange book you found to see where its creator might have gone.

[14:29:43] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Virius] Oh, you're quite right. I'm not, you are. This machine requires two people, one person whose mind is being probed, and one who is doing the probing. Obviously I can't risk my own life with something as dangerous as this.

[20:43:16] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sounds easy enough.]
[20:43:16] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Why an opal?]
[20:43:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Antoine] Opals are the opposite of onyxes. Instead of fueling and amplifying a curse, the opal will negate one.
[20:43:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sounds easy enough.]
[20:43:25] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Antoine] You would think, but opals have been out of style for decades. After onyxes were rounded up and destroyed, merchants stopped selling 'protective amulets' and other junk and soon the demand died down completely. Last I checked, the opal mines were closed completely.
[20:43:25] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where was the mine?]
[20:43:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Antoine] What do I look like? An atlas? I don't know! You should go ask the Royal Cartographer about the opal mine. He would know better than I. You can find him at the top of the alchemy building. Now go, and go quickly!

A number of miners were killed in the collapse and their spirits are said to roam the dark shafts still. They call it the Haunted Mine now. The shaft down to the Opal Mine can be found at the end of a path of red and white-spotted mushrooms. Be careful and watch out for spirits!

[06:20:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Yeigar] I was once a fighter too. A savior. I roamed the dunes, fighting for a cause I believed in, holding the strength of thousands in my hand.
[06:20:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What?]
[06:20:55] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Yeigar] My power was mighty. I knew of none who could challenge me. The strong cowered before me; the stronger still bent the knee or broke below my heel. The weak flocked to me, their protector. From this rose my empire - no, a nation. In the end though, while I was mighty, even I could not escape a deadly plague. It was then he came to me in my dreams. An explorer from beyond the sands.

[06:21:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where did you go?]
[06:21:20] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Yeigar] I was the King’s then, and he took me for his own whims. He used my power for himself. I was alive, in a way. A shade of myself. A memory of battle. But the true battle came, and I met my match. There were things after the King, so he sent me to defend him. I was struck down by these Knights, and my King was taken. That is the last thing I knew for generations.

[06:21:36] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Yeigar] The world I knew is nothing like what I’ve been shown here. I do not know the time frame, but I can tell you that thousands of years felt like a blink of an eye. My eyes have been closed for some time. But they did reopen, mere years ago. Something freed my King. And my King then freed me.

I’m so sorry you’ve fallen for his voice. I am sorry as well that I must take you away now. I hear his voice, calling me...  You should run before it is too late... You must be taken. I am his and you will be as well. Step into the Arena.

[14:12:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] At last, I have found the pedestal. Could it have the answers I seek? Will this offer me my way home? I have taken it from the Place of Power, away from where the others will reside one day. I suppose I should be grateful it was hidden away so well, that I could find it before people other than these... Tlaxan... could discover what they have hidden in this Jungle they protect so strongly. They have such command over memory, I have found, but yet they do not remember me.
[14:12:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Can you hear me?]
[14:13:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] I could never have found this place without the machinations of the Demon Summoner and his silly dreams to rip open the Veil. His deal was easy. He keeps his home, and I start my journey to find my own. This pedestal is only the beginning however. I need to know where the creators rest. They must be close. If they are not, all hope is lost.

[14:13:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Jeremiah] Of course. Yeigar, the Owner, was too strong a memory. I am still me. The Crimson King spoke to me when we were apart, and helped me understand what he wants. He's not out to kill you Sukie. He's been trying so hard to talk to you for so long, on his own terms.

[21:35:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Walter Jr.] Now, for your task. In this very valley is a wondrous place called Crescent Isle, where Pigkind lavish in beauty and luxury.
[21:35:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [That sounds majestic.]

[21:35:54] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Walter Jr.] It truly is! I want you to go there and speak to Percy. He's the massage therapist there. He's got a special potion I want.
[21:35:54] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sounds easy enough.]
[21:35:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Walter Jr.] You would think, but he likes to hide away at the top of the tower. The Isle is all the way west, across the ocean. Go sail!

[22:23:01] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Spit it out!]
[22:23:03] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Walter Jr.] Well, it's all because of Mawrmoch.

[04:10:15] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Dimitri] I've been staring over these notes that you found, and can't quite get my mind off something. There was something at the Axtan Monastery, something he was intensely determined to find. The real reason it's sticking in my mind though is that there's a new alchemist downstairs who seems to keep mumbling about secrets surrounding the Monastery. Could you perhaps talk to him and see if you can get some information? Maybe he knows something...

[04:12:40] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I've helped the Axtans before, could I do anything?]
[04:12:45] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Deranged Alchemist] I fear they wouldn't even listen to a trusted ally on this matter, but perhaps if... yes I know.
[04:12:45] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What?]
[04:12:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Deranged Alchemist] A scholar in a cottage by the Collapsed Tower is on the right path. I saw him when I finally made it out... Yes... The Axtans turned him away as well, but he has the pieces. He knows more than he thinks he does. Seek him out and aid his research.
[04:12:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Alright I'll see what I can find out.]
[04:12:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [This is starting to get a bit too convoluted for me.]
[04:13:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Deranged Alchemist] Splendid. Safe travels.

[04:13:04] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Scars of Magic: Speak to Keller near the Collapsed Tower.

[12:39:03] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Keller] I'm much too busy here to chat... Oh hello Sukie, it's been a while since we last spoke. What brings you to the Highlands?
[12:39:03] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'm looking for you actually.]
[12:39:03] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Just passing by.]
[12:39:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Keller] Oh really? Did you hear about the research I was doing into the Axtans and Siershen with Antigone? Did Bhairavi send you?
[12:39:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I have. I'm here to help you delve further, though I wasn't sent by Bhairavi.]
[12:39:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Something like that. What are you researching about the Axtans and Siershen?]
[12:39:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [No, nothing like that. I just wanted to say hi.]
[12:39:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Keller] That would be great but I believe I've hit a dead end here. My research and findings speak of a secret of Siershen's being guarded by the Axtans under this tower, but so far after scouring it top to bottom I've found nothing.
[12:39:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [So there's nothing I can do?]
[12:39:29] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Keller] Could you explore the Collapsed Tower for me? Maybe a second set of eyes could find something I did not. It's rather dangerous in there and I've never been much of a fighter. Hopefully there is a document or a book lying around that could help us better understand it's history. If only Brayllur wasn't busy...
[12:39:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Scars of Magic [1/2]: Find the logbook within the Collapsed Tower.
[12:39:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Scars of Magic [2/2]: Once you have the logbook return to Keller.
[12:39:45] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Keller] This is brilliant! Right beneath our feet there's something, we need to pursue this further.
[12:39:45] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What should we do next?]
[12:39:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Keller] Could you go and check on Antigone in Velara for me? I sent her there with some notes I found on how to unlock Siershen's study, so you should be able to follow and catch up to him. I think if we have more pieces to this puzzle things will start falling into place. I'll start researching what's in this book and I should have something for you when you return!
[12:39:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'll be on my way!]
[12:39:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Maybe another time.]

[13:01:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Keller] Look at this! This crystal is exactly what Siershen described in his notes. If my hypothesis is right, this will open up a "time bubble" around the tower, and allow us to access a version of it before it collapsed. I just need to crack it here and...
[13:01:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [And what?]

[13:01:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Keller] It has something to do with changing the Collapsed Tower I think. I'm actually not quite too sure, Siershen is very vague in what he wrote. It should allow us to get into the basement and learn more though! I just need to make one final mark on the crystal and the spell will be complete.
[13:01:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You are about to amplify the Collapsing Tower PoI. If you fail, you must return to Velara and recieve another charge to amplify it again. Are you prepared?

[13:35:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Abbot Johann] Hello again Sukie. For a long time we have been waiting to see if someone would get past Siershen's seal. I am not surprised it was you.
[13:35:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Why are you and Bhairavi here?]
[13:35:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Why aren't you stopping me now?]
[13:36:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Abbot Johann] After many years of turning people away to hide what lies below, I was in complete shock when your friend was able to deduce we were guarding a wool. Honestly, even us Axtans were not entirely sure what lied down there ourselves. It seems she's pieced together the trail you left behind and figured it out.
[13:36:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I figured it out as well.]
[13:36:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Abbot Johann] Sure you did, buddy.
[13:36:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wrangler Sedol] It appears there are greater threats to containing the Bastion than you. Thank you for fending off that crazed alchemist.
[13:36:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What's down below us?]
[13:36:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Why do you ranch creepers?]
[13:36:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wrangler Sedol] I think you will find out soon enough. Your friend Bhairavi will have more answers.
[13:36:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wrangler Sedol] It appears there are greater threats to containing the Bastion than you. Thank you for fending off that crazed alchemist.
[13:36:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What's down below us?]
[13:36:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Why do you ranch creepers?]
[13:36:25] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wrangler Sedol] It turns out that creepers are quite the deterrent! It tends to keep away most prying eyes, which keeps the entrance to the Bastion quite safe.
[13:36:31] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] So good to see you Sukie, especially outside of Nyr. Keller and Antigone have informed me of what you've found so far and I had a hunch you've stumbled upon another wool!
[13:36:31] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [There's a wool here?]
[13:36:31] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Why did you leave your office?]
[13:36:31] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What should I do now?]
[13:36:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] From what I've pieced together I believe that the artifact the Alchemist's Bastion is hiding is one of the wools.
[13:36:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'm going to go after the wool then.]
[13:36:45] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Excellent. I've conjured up a lobby with the Axtans at the bottom of this cave here. Head down there to begin your descent towards the wool.
[13:36:45] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'll do that.]
[13:36:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] See you back in Nyr! Best of luck.

[13:50:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Brother Selim] You've made it! Wonderful! I've quite honestly always wondered what's inside this place. Perhaps these can be of use to you inside. Good luck!

[12:21:56] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Maybe later.]
[12:21:59] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Buildmaster Jr.] Lovely! I need you to travel around this beautifully designed capital city of Sierhaven - no bias of course - and gather a few items for me. There's been some recent bandit attacks around this area, and I'd like to send a supply package to the neighboring town of Nyr!
