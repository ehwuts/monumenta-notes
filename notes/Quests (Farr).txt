==Fountain of Miracles==

[00:51:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Drake] Ah, I see it in your eyes, you're an adventurer. I used to be an adventurer like you, but then a cave spider crippled my leg. Stick around and talk for a bit and I'll buy you a drink.
[00:51:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sure, I'll listen]
[00:51:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Some other time]
[00:51:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Drake] Ha, good choice. And here's that drink I promised.
[00:51:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Received 1 Awful Ale
[00:51:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Drake] Now, I can tell you about my adventurers on the Air Rafts of Galos, Siege of Redstorm, or my search for the Fountain of Miracles.

[00:51:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fountain of Miracles]
[00:51:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Drake] Well you see, the Galos' lands have acid lakes that give off noxious fumes. So they've lashed giant wood platforms to ghasts and sail through the air. I was a sky pirate there, raiding and pillaging, but quit because the ghasts never shut up.

[00:51:43] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fountain of Miracles]
[00:51:45] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Drake] I was in the city of Redstorm when the Wheeler Legion put us to siege. Oh, the redstone cannons and poison launchers we had, technology you've never seen. After a year though they broke through the gates and started sacking the city, so I stole one of their uniforms and joined the party, ha!

[00:51:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fountain of Miracles]
[00:51:58] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Drake] Nearby, in the South of the Blackroot Jungle, the Tlaxani spoke of a magical Fountain. The waters from it could heal any wound. I spent years looking for it, but failed. You though, I think you've got a chance, what do you say?
[00:51:58] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'll start my search]
[00:51:58] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sounds too dangerous]
[00:52:07] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Drake] Haha, that's the spirit! Good luck out there, and watch out for spiders!

[00:52:07] [main/INFO]: [CHAT]  Length : Short
[00:52:07] [main/INFO]: [CHAT]  Difficulty : Hard
[00:52:07] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Look in the South of the jungle for a legendary fountain.

[22:28:27] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Spirit of the Fountain] Hello? Is someone there? If you can hear me, the fountain's source is corrupted. Dark druids have summoned foul grove creatures to pollute the water in the eastern lake. Slay the foul beasts on that forsaken island so that the fountain can be pure again.


[22:28:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Fountain of Miracles: The fountain has been corrupted! The island to the east of it must be purified by slaying the venomous spiders that dwell there.

[22:32:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You feel a corrupting influence lift from this forest. Perhaps you should return to the Fountain.

[22:33:05] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Fountain of Miracles: The beasts have been slain and the source purified! Return to the fountain in the caves for a blessing.

[22:35:27] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Spirit of the Fountain] Thank you hero, you have restored the healing magic of the fountain. Bathe in it to give yourself restorative powers. My magic cannot do much else, but thank you for your kindness, and beware the druids...

[22:35:36] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Fountain of Miracles: Return to Drake and tell him that the fountain has been purified.

[22:39:43] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] FOUNTAIN OF MIRACLES COMPLETE!
[22:39:43] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Awarded 4 Golden Apples, Water Robe, and 1 Prestige
[22:39:43] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Drake] You found it? Great job, I knew an adventurer like you could find it. I think it's time for me to hobble over there and dunk my leg in it.


==Lost in my Mind==
[20:46:04] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Eowen] This memorial should be beautiful. It's a lie.
[20:46:04] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Excuse me?]
[20:46:06] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Eowen] The attack on Farr 30 years ago. It killed so many. This memorial is a beautiful reminder of those who lost their lives. But it's a lie. My brother is still alive.
[20:46:06] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Who is your brother?]
[20:46:11] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Eowen] His name is Kurtis. It's right there on the memorial. I just have this overwhelming feeling he's still with us. He lived in a bunker outside town. He was sure something bad was coming. He prepared. There's no way he died.
[20:46:11] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Could I help you find him?]
[20:46:16] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Eowen] You could help, I suppose. I've been searching for him for 30 years though. Maybe some fresh eyes could find something I didn't, I guess. It's been so long...
[20:46:16] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where is his bunker? I'm ready to go.]
[20:46:16] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'll be back to help later.]
[20:46:21] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Eowen] You're serious about helping? I'll have to scrounge something up to pay you if you find something. Thank you.

[20:46:21] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Eowen] His bunker is just outside the southern city gate, down a trapdoor. It should be unlocked. I'd go with you, but I can't bear to return there anymore. It just hurts too much. I miss him Sukie...

[01:59:23] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Eowen] You've come back. Is it wrong of me to be surprised? Have you found anything?
[01:59:23] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I think I have. I found this book inside a hidden Safe Room.]
[01:59:26] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Eowen] Let me see it... Hmm... I... I don't know what to say. This is real? For real? He's really alive?
[01:59:26] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [That's what it seems.]
[01:59:30] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Eowen] Where is this warehouse? Who did he make a deal with? I don't understand.
[01:59:30] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I have the same questions. Do you have any ideas about the warehouse?]

[01:59:34] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Eowen] Not off the top of my head. Did you see anything that might help?
[01:59:34] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [There was a banner in the safe room all over. It was brown, with a white stripe and a red circle in the center.]
[01:59:36] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Alert] Monumenta will perform its daily restart in 15 seconds. This helps reduce lag! The server will be down for ~90 seconds.

[01:59:40] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [The Freetraders?]
[01:59:40] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Corrupted_Night left the game
[01:59:42] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Eowen] They were a group of mercenaries operating out of Sierhaven before the attack. Kurtis did work for them in the past. But they broke up before the attack, so why would their banner be in this safe room? And he mentions Maren, 'The Shady Trader'... Could something be going on in Sierhaven? This seems like a long shot though...
[01:59:42] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'll go poke around. Here's hoping it works.]
[01:59:43] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Eowen] I'm really hoping so.

[11:29:18] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Shady Trader] Would you like to purchase some spectacular items?
[11:29:18] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Shady Trader] They asked me to sell to you, and I'm sure you'd love our amazing replicas.

[11:30:35] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Kurtis] Please buy from me? I was the first, why can I not leave yet?
[11:30:35] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [You're Kurtis, aren't you?]
[11:30:40] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Kurtis] Yes! Are you here to buy from me?
[11:30:40] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [No, I'm here because your brother has been searching for you. For 30 years.]
[11:30:46] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Kurtis] I don't have a brother. I don't have a life beyond my sales. Not until I have finished.
[11:30:46] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Are you sure? Eowen said a man named Kurtis used to live in Farr, in a bunker, before a massive attack on the city. He thought you were dead.]
[11:30:59] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Kurtis] Eowen...? My... brother? He... he's been trying to find me?
[11:30:59] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Yes. He's not given up for decades. He knew you were alive.]
[11:31:04] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Kurtis] They came to me... I was trapped... I was offered a deal...
[11:31:04] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [And you took it. But we found you!]
[11:31:07] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Kurtis] I can't leave. I'm trapped. But Eowen isn't. He can live his life still. I still remember when we were just boys, playing by the banks of the river outside Farr. I fell in. I couldn't swim. He jumped in and saved me, nearly drowning in the process. He saved my life. I owe him the chance to keep living his, not hunting for me.
[11:31:07] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I...]
[11:31:17] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Kurtis] Here. I've spent a long time writing down what happened the day of the attack. Eowen needs to know. I can't stay though. I must sell... They told me... Quickly, take this, before I forget again. Memory is tough here...
[11:31:17] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Kurtis] Please buy from me? I was the first, why can I not leave yet?

[11:37:36] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Eowen looks at the journal, his eyes full of hope and optimism.
[11:37:36] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] As he flips through the pages his eyes begin to dim.
[11:37:36] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] As he reaches the last page his eyes are like the void, absent of the light he started with.
[11:37:36] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Eowen] He... is in this much pain? He felt that much guilt? He is the only reason I'm alive today, my home was leveled to the ground. I only survived since I ran and hid like a coward. I should be the one with guilt for leaving the town to die, not him.
[11:37:36] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Eowen] Sadly I can't honor his request. He doesn't deserve this fate, no one does. I have much research to do.
[11:37:36] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Eowen] In the mean time though have the reward I promised you. Thank you for showing me the path I must take.

We haven't seen them in twelve days. I've heard some bad rumors that make me nervous, so could you go check on them?
[20:38:21] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Absolutely!]
[20:38:21] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Not right now.]

My collection of pyroclastic flows is drying up, and require new samples from the geologic features nearby. What do you say old chum, think you could dig up three fresh magma samples?
[22:06:15] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sure, I like geology]
[22:06:15] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I don't think so]
[22:06:25] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Carbocius] Ah ha, I think I just heard an enthusiastic 'yes'! Brilliant old chap, it's great to see that passion for geology still runs rampant! Three magma samples from three different geologic features, bring them here quick before they harden, chop chop.

[20:22:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [How do I do that?]
[20:22:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [T'Lm] I will send you into Velara to claim three herbs. You will take these herbs to the Totems and their power will be refreshed and restored.

[17:10:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Erwen] The final hunt. You will need Soulleather, which is made from the flesh of the legendary Questing Beast, to bind the Bestiary with. This is a special beast- to put it frankly, I don't think you can kill it.
[17:10:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I have heard that one before, they were proven wrong.]
[17:10:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Erwen] I do not mean to insult your skill. I meant it literally, it has powerful regenerative properties. It'll heal from a wound faster than you can make another. All you need is a cut of its flesh for the soulleather, which makes the real hunt actually locating the damn thing in the first place.

It rarely even steps into the swamp at all. It's gotta be hiding somewhere, but Sierhaven is a big city. The Polling Place in Sierhaven would be a good place to start. It used to be a stable you know, and I'd reckon there's some old unused space that would make a good hiding spot, due to the likely leftover water and animal feed.

[17:17:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Donkey Attendant] What's going on down here? Oh my god, Hubert, did this person hurt you? You! Get out, right now!
[17:17:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Donkey Attendant] What do you think you were doing? Breaking and entering, attacking my poor Hubert!

[17:17:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Donkey Attendant] You think I don't know that? I captured him and took him down here to take care of him! He's happy here, not having to get slaughtered out in the wild for people to make clothes with his flesh! I treat him like royalty and in exchange, he lets me take trimmings from his horn.
[17:17:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What do you need the horn trimmings for?]

[17:17:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Donkey Attendant] Do you really not know?! Quest compasses have to come from somewhere, and Hubert's horn trimmings make excellent needles and put the "Quest" in quest compass! Now off with you! I don't want to see you back here again, you can go mail in your votes or something if you need to vote...

[17:19:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Erwen] You return, hunter. Is the deed done?
[17:19:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Well...]
[17:19:04] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You explain how the Questing Beast was already captured and likely content not having to die repeatedly.
[17:19:04] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Erwen] Ah, can't say I'm upset to hear that. Much better than getting slaughtered over and over, I imagine. Still, did you get some flesh for the Soulleather?
[17:19:04] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I did.]
