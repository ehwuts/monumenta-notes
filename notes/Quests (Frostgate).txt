[20:04:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Harmonious Spirit] A utopia for but a few, or so they said. Yet here I am, stuck in my misery. Was I forsaken, or was I right all along?
[20:04:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'm sorry to interrupt your eternity of suffering, but what are you talking about?]
[20:04:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Good luck with your problems, ghost.]
[20:05:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Harmonious Spirit] ...You can see me? No one has been able to see me before... which is largely why I don't have to pay rent.
[20:05:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Harmonious Spirit] Hm. Perhaps you have a strong connection to souls. My tale is long, do you wish for the entire story, or the short version?
[20:05:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [The short version.]
[20:05:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [The long version.]
[20:05:09] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Rodogorgon left the game
[20:05:17] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Harmonious Spirit] My people lived in harmony with the world. We split into four groups, each aligned to a season. Part of our duty was to protect our greatest treasure, an item of immeasurable power.
[20:05:17] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [A wool?]
[20:05:17] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What was it?]
[20:05:18] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Rodogorgon joined the game
[20:05:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Joan055 joined the game
[20:05:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Rodogorgon left the game
[20:05:25] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Harmonious Spirit] I really don't remember- none of us on the outside did. However, those inside knew, and every year they chose one person from each of the four groups to join them inside. Once inside, they would grant their people all sorts of wonderful gifts and blessings. It was an honor to be chosen... for most, anyway.
[20:05:25] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Most?]
[20:05:25] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [So you weren't happy.]
[20:05:36] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Harmonious Spirit] Indeed, I was happy in my village. I neither wanted to leave, nor did I trust those that had went before me. I can't really say why, but something felt off about the whole thing. There were too many unanswered questions. I fought against the system.
[20:05:36] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [How did that go?]
[20:05:36] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [And now you are a ghost.]
[20:05:41] [main/WARN]: Unknown custom packed identifier: venturechat:data
[20:05:41] [main/WARN]: Unknown custom packed identifier: venturechat:data
[20:05:46] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Harmonious Spirit] I don't remember much of anything past that. I recall rebelling, but everything afterwards is a blur. When I came to, I was a ghost, and everything had changed for my people. No longer were they given blessings. Even when the next group was selected, the gifts stayed absent. Soon, madness began to set in, as did desperation.
[20:05:46] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Does this involve me in any way?]
[20:05:46] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [So you doomed your people. How am I relevant?]
[20:05:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Rodogorgon joined the game
[20:06:01] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Harmonious Spirit] I want to know how I died, and why I died. Perhaps by learning that I will be able to move on. If I'm right, maybe even my people will be able to move on. As the first person to be able to see me, I must ask you to help me.
[20:06:01] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What would I have to do?]
[20:06:01] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I prefer not being cursed.]
[20:06:09] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Harmonious Spirit] Opening the way inside shouldn't be too hard. You need to visit the four homes of my people- the seasonal shrines- and gain the blessings of each of them. They have changed somewhat over the years, but they are a peaceful people, so you shouldn't be in too much danger. Return here after you have visited all four.

[23:00:40] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Harmonious Spirit] Yes, I detect the blessings upon you. You are now ready to enter the Arboretum. At one point, it served as a rite of passage for my people to travel to the Arboretum's doors, but I dare not guess what it is like now.
[23:00:40] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Couldn't I have just broken inside?]
[23:00:46] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Harmonious Spirit] No... I mean technically? However, if something dangerous had been in there, it might have been able to escape if you had gone about it that way. In addition you wouldn't have been recognized by the magic of the area and would find it difficult to attune the teleporters to get back out. Regardless, you will need to head through the Sealed Descent to get to the Arboretum.
[23:00:58] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Harmonious Spirit] I will meet you beneath what your people know as the Sealed Descent. It is there that you will find your way into our most sacred place.

[23:20:55] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pretty well!]
[23:20:57] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Herriot the Loyal] That's good to hear! I, personally, have been waiting for destiny- destiny of the greatest legends!
[23:20:57] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What kind of destiny are you, uh... destined for?]
[23:21:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Herriot the Loyal] I am destined to wield a great blade in order to protect our Queen, Synnove Obregson, from the most dangerous of threats!
[23:21:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Could I perhaps help to quicken the arrival of that destiny?]
[23:21:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sounds like a worthy destiny that will eventually come!]

[23:21:20] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Locate the destined blade for Herriot.

[23:21:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Fabled Destiny: Visit Anette in the Bazaar and ask her where the fabled blade might be.

[23:22:38] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Anette] Greetings! Welcome to the Frostgate Bazaar. I'm in charge of the traders that enter this place.
[23:22:38] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Herriot said you know about a destined blade?]
[23:22:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Anette] Ach, is he going on about his destiny again? I guess, if you do find it, it might shut him up for once.
[23:22:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [So do you know where it is?]
[23:22:46] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Anette] Yes but, well, from all of the ancient scrolls I've read, the only thing that tells of this sword's location is a riddle...
[23:22:46] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hit me with it!]
[23:22:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Anette] Alright, here it is: "Tall doth stand the glowing trunks bending slight the bolete trove. On snow-strewn plains the crystal grove do hide the blade, of power drunk. Beware the crystals, oft attuned to icy grasps in the hidden shrine. But folly to the weak aligned 'tis sinister, destiny is hewn."

[23:25:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Fabled Destiny: Solve the riddle and travel to where it's leading you to. (Anette can always tell you the riddle again).
Spoilers: Crystal Forest Grove

[23:46:54] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Fabled Destiny: Return to Herriot with the blade once you have retrieved it.

[23:47:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Herriot the Loyal] Have you located the blade?
[23:47:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Why yes I have!]
[23:47:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Herriot the Loyal] Perfect! My destiny, it is being fulfilled at last! I feel the blade's power in my hand... So... magnificient...
[23:47:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] He gazes in awe at the sword.
[23:47:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Herriot? Are you ok?]
[23:47:57] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Herriot the Loyal] With all of this power... I feel UNSTOPPABLE!
[23:47:57] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Herriot?!]
[23:47:57] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Be ready for a fight!
[23:48:10] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Herriot the Loyal] And you... will be the first to yield to its power!!

[23:48:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Fabled Destiny: Fight Herriot to knock some sense into him!

[23:48:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Herriot drops the sword and stumbles over by his desk.

[23:48:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Fabled Destiny: Speak with Herriot to see if he's ok.

[23:48:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Herriot the Loyal] I'm... not worthy... what... happened to me? I'm no knight. I do not deserve this title...
[23:48:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Herriot, are you alright?]
[23:48:53] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Herriot the Loyal] Yes, I believe so. That blade is too powerful for a mortal to wield- it's a good thing it broke in our scrap. I also may have forgotten that we're both protected in the city, so both of our blows wouldn't have done anything anyways.
[23:48:53] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Are you gonna be ok?]
[23:49:03] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Herriot the Loyal] Yes, it appears my destiny has changed... Thank you again friend, you've made me see that.

[23:53:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Squire Tano] Sorry, I saw you talking to Sam over there. I know he misses the Marshall, but I still can't let either of you into his office.

[23:53:16] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sam Ludvic] Y'know, I saw that coming. Alright, easy plan didn't work, so on to the ridiculous plan. I need you to gather some materials: a Steel Woodcutter, a Trebuchet Stone from the city's defenses, and some gloop. You'll also probably want a sword, in case I can't think of a good enough distraction...

There's some cracks in the floor nearby, and, while we wouldn't be able to put a whole chunk of slime there, we could pour gloop into the cracks! Not sure I've ever heard of that anywhere in the Isles though- seems like it's more of a swampy kind of thing.

[00:43:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Guard Timmeh] Sukie right? It seems that the Baroness was killed at her own banquet. I've heard a lot of good things about you so I kept an eye on you during the entire banquet.
[00:43:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Keeping an eye on me?]
[00:43:21] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Guard Timmeh] And a good thing too. I think it's safe to say that you aren't the one who killed the Baroness. You were out here where I could see you the whole time. The others however...
[00:43:21] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What are you going to do then?]
[00:43:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Guard Timmeh] Nobody will be allowed to leave the banquet until we find the killer, I'm keeping an eye out on the crime scene so that nobody tampers with the evidence. I can't be two places at once, but if I stand here then I can't properly investigate the murder... Could you help me?
[00:43:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sure!]

[00:50:17] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [The Baroness was holding that cloth. Do you think it belongs to her killer?]
[00:50:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Guard Timmeh] I think so. We have ourselves a lead. Keep up the good work!
[00:50:23] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Guard Timmeh] We should look for the weapon that was used to kill the Baroness. Find it and use this on it. It's a kit that will hopefully get a fingerprint from the weapon. 
[00:50:23] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Right click on an object with the kit in hand to get a fingerprint from it.
[00:50:23] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Guard Timmeh] We will need a fingerprint from the murder weapon. Oh- and if you can, go around and see if you can get some fingerprints from things that people have touched. If we find a match then it will be easier to narrow the suspect list down. Here, use this to write down any notes you think are important.

I acted immaturely because Morina and I have a fairly heated rivalry and I was angry because Cori knew this, but I understand why she asked Morina to paint her portrait. Her late father had asked Morina in the past to paint his portrait so she must have done so to honor his memory...

When she found out that my mining operation in Ishnir was mainly harvesting opals, I thought she was going to flip and stop supporting me. But... she simply accepted it and continued to support me...

I was drawn to that so I offered to be her personal designer.

[01:49:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Jerry] We were going to open a business together here in Chillwind. I recently took a trip to the Narsen Empire and discovered a delicious Tlaxan cuisine. They said they eat it during religious ceremonies but it's just too good to not have more often. They called it pizza?

[01:53:32] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Guard Timmeh] So you think Jerry killed the Baroness?
[01:53:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Guard Timmeh] It looks like he was the owner of the Ornate Canteen, whose fingerprint matched the print we found on the murder weapon. He also lied about his whereabouts at the time of the murder. And finally, if you look at his attire, the Scrap of Cloth we found in the hand of the Baroness matches his jacket. Based on the evidence you found, he's definitely the killer. Excellent work. I'll detain him immediately!
