==Siege of Highwatch==
[17:34:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Starn] Hello there Sukie.
[17:34:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hi Starn. What are you doing here?]
[17:34:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Starn] I'm just interviewing the Commander here for Bhairavi. I'm sure she'll let you know if my research pans out!
[17:34:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] Welcome, Vargos told me you were coming. We've also been preparing for an assault on the Sons of the Forest and our prepa-
[17:34:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You hear ghasts and screaming from outside
[17:34:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] Damn! They're coming again! We could use your help, any chance you're good with a bow?
[17:34:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Make sure you are fully geared and ready to fight before accepting!
[17:34:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Yes, I'll help!]
[17:34:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [No, I have to go]
[17:35:10] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] That's what I like to hear! Now get to a tower and get ready for a fight.
[17:35:10] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] QUEST : THE SIEGE OF HIGHWATCH
[17:35:10] [main/INFO]: [CHAT]  Length : Medium
[17:35:10] [main/INFO]: [CHAT]  Difficulty : Hard
[17:35:10] [main/INFO]: [CHAT]  Help defend Highwatch!
[17:35:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] We just need to hold the ghasts off for a few minutes while Josiah gets the wards up, then we can take the fight to them. Hold fast!
[17:35:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] Here they come!

[17:35:43] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Siege Of Highwatch: Highwatch is under attack! Grab your bow, report to Commander Haynes, and get out there!

[17:36:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] Josiah's halfway done, keep firing!
[17:38:01] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] Just a few more moments!
[17:38:21] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] Josiah's spell is up, we're clear of the ghasts! Somewhere out there is their summoning stone! Grab that pickaxe and destroy it!

[17:38:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Siege Of Highwatch [1/2]: The ghasts may be down but the battle isn't won yet! Destroy the Sons of the Forest's summoning stone!
[17:38:40] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Siege Of Highwatch [2/2]: If you find yourself outside of the instanced area speak to Commander Haynes to get back into it.

[17:39:29] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] Haha, great job! That should stop the attack. Come to my office, I've got some good news!

[17:39:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Siege Of Highwatch: Commander Haynes has some good news, rest up after that battle and then report to her office.

[17:39:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] Hahaha! Great job, Highwatch might've fallen without you. More good news, Ursan and his scouts captured one of their Wardens. He's down in the cells right now. Their fortress is protected with magic, so see if you can get him to tell us how to get past it.

[17:40:03] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Siege Of Highwatch: During the battle the Highwatch Scouts captured a Warden of the Forest! Head to the cells and see if you can get any information out of him.

[17:42:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] He spits in your face
[17:42:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] He makes a rude gesture

[17:42:50] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sergeant Alton] He refuses to tell us anything, and I can guarantee we can't force it out of him. But, I've heard that the old Shamans hate those crazy druids as much as we do and might know how to make a truth serum... Just sayin.

[17:42:28] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Siege Of Highwatch: The only way you're going to get information out of that prisoner is with a truth serum. Find a Tlaxan Shaman and see if she'll help out.

[17:47:05] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [C'Taz] I will not make it myself, but my workshop is yours to use. If you are making what I think you are, you require a deadly fish, found east within a sunken pool in the jungle, as well as four reagents and a recipe from my workshop.
[17:47:05] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Let me into the workshop.]

[22:17:11] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Siege Of Highwatch: With truth serum in hand, head back to Highwatch and interrogate the captured Warden. See if you can get him to tell you how to get into their inner sanctum.

[22:22:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sergeant Alton] You actually got a Shaman to make a truth potion? You are somethin else.
[22:22:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I want to exit the cells]
[22:22:57] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Siege Of Highwatch: With truth serum in hand, head back to Highwatch and interrogate the captured Warden. See if you can get him to tell you how to get into their inner sanctum.
[22:23:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You slip the truth serum into his water and his eyes glaze over
[22:23:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Warden] You may have entombed me here, but it is pointless. Our magic is mightier than ever, far beyond when we clashed with your Archmages thirty years ago. Our magic will triumph. This castle will fall. The Empire will fall. And you will die too.
[22:23:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Why is your magic stronger?]
[22:23:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What is your plan?]
[22:23:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [How do I get into your sanctum?]
[22:23:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Warden] A man appeared four months ago, clad in a black mask. He was sympathetic and gave us an ancient artifact. Touching it focuses your mind and sends liquid fire through your veins. Channeling its power, one man could destroy an army.
[22:23:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What is your plan?]
[22:23:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [How do I get into your sanctum?]
[22:23:23] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Warden] An ancient spell. We will summon the spirit of the Blackroot, an ageless elemental being embodying the fury and decay of the jungle itself. We will loose it upon your cities. It will tear apart fortresses as the ground beneath your feet turns to peat and the insects rend the flesh from your bones.
[22:23:23] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Why is your magic stronger?]
[22:23:23] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [How do I get into your sanctum?]
[22:23:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Warden] The barrier within the Verdant Fortress repels anyone not wearing a shroud made of woven mistleaves and sanctified with blood magic. Wearing this will let you through the barrier and make you all but invisible to the wardens patrolling the inner sanctum.
[22:23:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Why is your magic stronger?]
[22:23:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What is your plan?]
[22:23:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] This should be enough information to get in when the time is right.
[22:23:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] SIEGE OF HIGHWATCH COMPLETE!
[22:23:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Awarded Highstorm, 128 Enchanting Bottles, and 1 Prestige

[22:25:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sergeant Alton] Make sure to talk to Josiah if you haven't already.

==Unveiled==
[19:10:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Josiah] Greetings! Up here you can buy some of the finest magical and alchemical supplies in the land. All designed by yours truly of course.
[19:10:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Do you know anything about Mistleaves?]
[19:10:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> CatProductions » Yo, anyone know where the circus ticket fuser is in lowtide
[19:10:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Josiah] Yes, and I can make a mistleaf hood, but... why would you possibly want one? It takes some serious dark magic to put that together and I can't think of any practical use.
[19:10:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [A prisoner said it's the only way inside the Verdant Fortress' inner sanctum.]
[19:10:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I've dealt with dark magic before]
[19:10:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [It's top secret]
[19:10:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> [WAIFU] Pakstf » sec
[19:10:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Josiah] ... You want to go into the Verdant Sanctum...? You're insane. But, you did help save Highwatch, so if anyone can do it I guess it'll be you.
[19:10:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] QUEST : UNVEILED
[19:10:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Length : Long
[19:10:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Difficulty : Very Hard
[19:10:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Assault the Verdant Fortress and stop the fiendish plans of the Sons of the Forest.

[19:11:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Unveiled: Work with Josiah on the magic to learn how to infiltrate the Sons of the Forest's fortress.

[19:11:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Josiah] Alright, I have most of the ingredients I need in order to make you a Mistleaf Hood, I'll just need you to bring me two things; a dozen fresh Mistleaves and a magic wand imbued with dark magic.
[19:11:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where can I find Mistleaves?]
[19:11:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where can I find such a wand?]
[19:12:06] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Josiah] Mistleaves tend to grow in the center of fairy circles and other strongly magical locations. The forest nearby is probably the best shot, but be wary, it's a dangerous place. Twelve should be enough to weave the hood together.

[19:12:09] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where can I find Mistleaves?]
[19:12:09] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where can I find such a wand?]
[19:12:15] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Josiah] Maybe you could find such a wand in the graveyard? I've heard that a powerful sorcerer was buried down there, perhaps such a foul wand would be inside his tomb?

[19:13:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Josiah] Mistleaves and a Wand of Blood! Just what I needed. Now... the thing with a Mistleaf Hood is that they can only be put on your head once, if you take them off they lose their shape and can't be worn anymore. I'll make a bunch, so let me know when you want one. Until then, you should check back in with Haynes, I think she has a plan.

[19:14:09] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Unveiled: Talk to Haynes and get her plan of attack on the fortress.

[19:14:38] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] You never cease to amaze me soldier. Hopefully you will be willing to work with us again in the future.
[19:14:38] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] Excellent, it sounds like Josiah's ready to go. But invisibility alone won't be enough; any disturbance in the Sons of the Forest's inner sanctum and their full force will come running. Which means we'll need a distraction.
[19:14:38] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What kind of distraction?]
[19:14:38] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [How about explosives?]
[19:14:38] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Why not burn them out]
[19:14:46] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] I considered something subtle, but I think enough explosives to level a small town will suffice. Lieutenant Kathryn, my chief bombardier, is in position setting up her cannons. Look to the treetops near their Verdant Fortress and see what she needs for the assault.

[19:14:58] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Unveiled: Meet with Kathryn in the treetops near the fortress and help her prepare the bombardment.

[00:58:01] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Kathryn] You're not supposed to be up here! This is secret! Clandestine! Classif-ah whatever. Just don't touch anything or this whole forest might explode.
[00:58:01] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Haynes sent me. She said you're going to bombard the fortress]
[00:58:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Kathryn] That's right, but there's a catch. If bombing them were that easy we'd have wiped them off the face of the earth thirty years ago. First problem: the fortress itself is immensely strong and none of my explosives can actually breach it. Believe me, I've tried.
[00:58:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Can't we just use more explosives?]
[00:58:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [So we need stronger explosives?]
[00:58:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> [FISH] EmilyVEVO » no
[00:58:10] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> [FISH] EmilyVEVO » it should be supreme
[00:58:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> [FISH] EmilyVEVO » or mythic
[00:58:15] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> [FISH] TheCrusader57 » Because it's unbreakable
[00:58:20] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Kathryn] Bingo! Regular TNT, alchemical potions, bomb arrows, nothing worked! I need stronger explosives. Find me an expert on fire. Explosives. Lava. Anything! As long as I can get something better than regular TNT, we can blow this fortress into rubble! Try asking around Farr, I've heard there's an old alchemist who lives there.

[00:58:32] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Unveiled: Search for an alchemist who can teach you how to make stronger explosives.

[01:01:30] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Carbocius] Look at this, old chap, these paleocurrents are lovely. Oooh, and we... you didn't come here to listen to me ramble, did you. What did you want?
[01:01:30] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Do you know anything about explosives?]
[01:01:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Carbocius] I, uh, no! No, of course not! I don't know anything about Hyper TNT. Why, I've never even heard of it!
[01:01:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hyper TNT?]
[01:01:44] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Carbocius] I... uh... um... Just, just forget I mentioned it. I developed it back while working in the old Alchemy Labs, before the spill happened, but it's entirely too dangerous for anyone to use!
[01:01:44] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Perhaps another line of questioning will work better...
[01:01:54] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Unveiled: Find Carbocius's old laboratory and use it to make the Hyper TNT!
[01:01:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Carbocius] Good evening, what did you need? Please don't tell me you were still going to ask about that hyper TNT again.
[01:01:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sooo... Hyper TNT?]

[01:01:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where did you test explosives?]
[01:02:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Carbocius] Oh, about fifteen years ago. All the fumes just didn't seem healthy anymore and so I turned to my second passion, geology.
[01:02:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Carbocius] Good evening, what did you need? Please don't tell me you were still going to ask about that hyper TNT again.

[01:02:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where did you test explosives?]
[01:02:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Carbocius] When the alchemy labs shut down and we moved to the current labs they put me near that giant water vat next to the castle since all my explosives kept, well, exploding.

[01:02:28] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] treebeard68 left the game
[01:02:29] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Carbocius] Well, they didn't totally shut down the alchemy labs. One wing of it got converted into an underground bunker for testing. We had to keep a huge water vat right above it though, so we could flood it in case anything got out of control.

[01:02:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Carbocius] Oh, it was an easy choice. So many fascinating geologic features nearby, and unlike Sierhaven, I never have to worry about anyone popping out of secret tunnels. They're everywhere down there, even underwater! Why, one even led to my workshop so I always got unwelcome guests.

[01:02:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Carbocius] *sigh* I already told you, it's too dangerous! I never even published it! The only place that recipe exists is in my head and my notes in that old workshop.

[01:03:06] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Unveiled: Find Carbocius's old laboratory and use it to make the Hyper TNT!

[01:26:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Kathryn] That... that TNT! It's so unstable! Dangerous! Destructive! It's absolutely perfect. I'll prep the cannons, you get that mistleaf hood on and let me know when you're ready to attack!

[01:31:01] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Josiah] I've got a supply of Mistleaf Hoods ready to go, just let me know when you and Haynes are ready to go with whatever your master plan is. Be careful though, its effects might not work while wet.

[01:46:55] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Sounds of screaming rage against your eardrums as you break the crystal. It's probably best if you hurry to the sanctum.

[01:47:44] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Unveiled: Infiltrate the Inner Sanctum and destroy whatever foes and spells stand in your way!

[01:59:54] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Josiah's Projection] Hah, I knew you'd make here! Now, listen carefully. To truly destroy their sanctum you'll need to break one more spell crystal. A magma block creating a barrier that makes their secrets undetectable to magical sight. Make sure you're prepared and let me know when you're ready to enter.

[02:00:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'm ready]
[02:00:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What do I need to do?]
[02:00:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I need more preparation]
[02:00:15] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Josiah's Projection] Be careful in there. Not only are there powerful enemies, but if you fall in the water not even the mistleaf hood can protect you.
[02:00:15] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] There are three different instances of the inner sanctum to let multiple groups in simultaneously. Choose which one you would like to enter. If doing this with friends, make sure you all enter the same instance!

[13:50:40] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Josiah] You vanished right after you touched the Black Shard! What happened in there!? Did you get the Shard?
[13:50:40] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I was pulled into Kaul's nightmare]
[13:50:40] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I have the Black Shard]
[13:50:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Josiah] Oh. Oh wow. That... doesn't sound right. I've heard old Tlaxan stories and it sounded like his dreams were supposed to be pleasant, thoughts of nature and life. They must have been corrupted the ritual the Sons of the Forest were doing.
[13:50:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Josiah] You vanished right after you touched the Black Shard! What happened in there!? Did you get the Shard?
[13:50:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I was pulled into Kaul's nightmare]
[13:50:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I have the Black Shard]
[13:50:57] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Josiah] Impressive. It looks like the Sons of the Forest drained huge amounts of power from it for their ritual, but it still has an astounding amount. It's no good anymore for any huge spells, but imbued into an item should grant it protective powers. Try talking to Antonio downstairs, he makes all the armor here.
[13:50:57] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You show Josiah the Black Shard
[13:51:04] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Unveiled: Work with Mastersmith Antonio to imbue an item with the Black Shard's power.
[13:51:09] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Josiah] Antonio should be able to help with the Shard, although what's happening with Kaul is disturbing. Old Tlaxan stories made it sound as if Kaul's dreams were pleasant, thoughts of nature and life. They must have been corrupted by the ritual the Sons of the Forest were doing.

[01:01:50] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Unveiled: Work with Mastersmith Antonio to imbue an item with the Black Shard's power.

[01:02:03] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I need your help infusing this magical shard from the Black Wool into an item.]
[01:02:07] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mastersmith Antonio] The BLACK WOOL?! How did you get that?
[01:02:07] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [The Sons of the Forest had it. I stopped them.]
[01:02:10] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mastersmith Antonio] That's fantastic! I'll hold onto it and study how to infuse it, but I believe it can imbue any item with Hope. When you know what item you'd like to infuse with Hope, hold it and speak to me again.

[01:03:03] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Unveiled: Work with Mastersmith Antonio to imbue an item with the Black Shard's power.

[01:07:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mastersmith Antonio] Let me know once you have decided what item to infuse with this Black Shard. Sofia and I believe we've found the right way to meld it your equipment to give it new power.
[01:07:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You may choose to infuse any one item from King's Valley or the Celsian Isles. This is a permanent improvement to the item - it will gain the Hope enchantment, making it invulnerable when dropped and increasing its despawn time by 5 minutes. In addition, your player name will be added to the item's description. You may only enhance one item - so choose wisely. You do not have to claim this reward right away.
[01:07:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Make sure the item is on your hotbar and currently selected before continuing! Do not try to use a stack of more than one item, the extras will be destroyed!
[01:07:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'll think about it some more. ]
[01:07:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I have chosen an item.]

[01:07:43] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mastersmith Antonio] We'll be back. Sofia, it's time to get to work!
[01:07:46] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mastersmith Antonio] It is finished! Some of our finest work... May it serve you well.

[23:25:40] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Argent] Carlton, the former accountant of the Five Axes Trading Company has left.

There's a basement with a vault in it, but you have to solve a maze to get there. I don't know all the tricks, but I remember hearing to 'follow the shadows'. I hope that helps you bring him in.
