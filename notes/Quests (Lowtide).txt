[23:47:30] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Captain Indigo] Clearly not, at least not yet. Well do you happen to know any pirates?
[23:47:30] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Arrgh! There be one lad I know in a pub in Sierhaven who plunders.]
[23:47:43] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Captain Indigo] Please don't try to speak like a pirate ever again. You're awful at it. But any pirate would be better than you so maybe you can help me! I'm trying to put together a crew for my ship here, could you go speak to your friend about joining it?

[23:49:28] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Levyn] Ahoy Sukie! To what do I owe my favorite matey today?
[23:49:28] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I've got a pirate job offer for you.]
[23:49:32] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Levyn] Shiver me timbers and call me a bosun, just tell me where to report to!
[23:49:32] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Captain Indigo has a ship docked in Lowtide, you should go speak with her.]
[23:49:51] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Levyn] Aye I will! I expect I'll be seeing you over there as well?
[23:49:51] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sure I'll come visit.]
[23:49:51] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Of course, I need to claim my reward.]
[23:50:14] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Levyn] Aargh!

[23:51:16] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Captain Indigo] You've done good, I think. Levyn is quite the character, but he seems very comfortable below deck. We're going to need more crew, but for now Levyn has a request of you.

[23:51:48] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Levyn] This be quite the fine vessel. I can't wait to set sail.
[23:51:48] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Indigo said you had a task for me?]
[23:51:51] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Levyn] Aye! I appear to have landed the position of Lookout. Likely cuz of my arrr-mazing eye. But in order to do the job right I'll be needing the perfect spyglass, matey.
[23:51:51] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where can I find you a spyglass?]

[23:51:56] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> Cloud_ » And what for I wonder?
[23:51:59] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Levyn] Not just any spyglass, friend. I need the famed spyglass of Captain Bijou! Even my parrot doesn't know where to find it though. I saw a book house or whatever they're called on my way into this piratey town though! Maybe they know where Bijou's voyage ended!

[23:53:39] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Chief Editor Sumona] Hi, welcome to the Library. I'm Sumona, the head of editing and curation here. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
[23:53:39] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [No, I'm just browsing.]
[23:53:39] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'm on a mission to find the spyglass of Captain Bijou.]
[23:53:42] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Chief Editor Sumona] Ah, now that's quite the story. Bijou was a pirate captain based out of Sierhaven who sailed under the Narsen banner.
[23:53:42] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Narsen banner? But he was a pirate.]
[23:53:42] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Ah, so he was a privateer]
[23:53:46] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> Cloud_ » Nevermind I'm back in Sier
[23:53:50] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Chief Editor Sumona] Indeed. For a share of his plunder the Crown would leave him be.
[23:53:50] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [That sounds wrong.]
[23:53:50] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [That's a great deal.]
[23:53:58] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> Cloud_ » Nice load times now, whatever they did to ease lag just recently
[23:53:59] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Chief Editor Sumona] I, well, um. I suppose so from one perspective.
[23:53:59] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Chief Editor Sumona] Anyways, some other pirates weren't too happy about the deal Bijou had with the Crown, so one night they made their way to where his ship was tied down and cut it loose. Before anyone could flee, it went over the waterfall by Nyr and the wreckage floated down the river!
[23:53:59] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [That's tragic!]

[00:25:45] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Royal Cartographer] Ahh yes these coordinates are nautical, you see .1 seaports is a block west and .1 seabows is a block north. It looks like the message is referring to the banner behind the Apartments, so you should set sail from there!

[00:34:33] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] A Crew to Remember: Follow the coordinates in the message to the stranded Navigator. Be ready for anything.

[01:02:59] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Samwell] Look it's simple, the local guards are on high alert and know some of the familiar shifty faces, but they don't know you to have a bad reputation. Will you make the delivery?
[01:02:59] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I suppose I have to.]
[01:02:59] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'll think about it.]
[01:03:00] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Samwell] Good now you need to go to the bottom of the waterfall outside Nyr and find a place called the Murky Maze. In there you'll see a veil of water, our drop-off point is behind it. Make sure you place the goods and only the goods in the chest. Now take this and scram.

[18:24:04] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'm sorry, I'm not much of a chef]
[18:24:20] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Claude] Marvelous! Fantastique! I 'ave some ideas but we shall need the most exotic of ingredients! I 'ave 'eard of an old Tlaxan farm, where the lava imparts the most wonderful flavor to the wheat there. Let us start by gathering that, and see what pairs with it, no?

[13:19:28] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Claude] Mmm! The wheat itself is as wonderful as I 'ave been told, but we need more than just grains and vegetables. Lowtide is known for its fish, but I think some beef of the 'ighest quality will pair better. The Korbaran Beef of the Korbar Highlands is said to be fantastique, think you can find one for the dish?

[13:26:47] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Claude] Hmm. For a normal dish, this would satisfy. 'owever, we are not making just any dish, but my masterpiece! I think we will need something even more esoteric. I 'ear tales of a dangerous cave within the Highland's lake, perhaps there will be some meat in there we can use.
[13:26:47] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'll investigate]

[13:27:01] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Claude] Marvelous! Every time I see your vigor I am more and more inspired! While you are out searching the cave I might go 'unting for some game of my own. Be careful though, I 'ear rumors of awful and 'orrid things occuring within that cave.
[13:27:01] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Claude quickly sears the beef and bites into the barely rare steak.

[13:27:40] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] A Dish to Die For: According to Claude, some meat can be found in the Cave Of Bones near Highwatch, go get some.

[00:48:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Who was that?]
[00:48:43] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Helring] That... that was Azacor. But Aesir killed him... I don't understand. Sukie, we need to stop him.
[00:48:43] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Stop him? What is he doing?]
[00:48:43] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Well he seems angry, I probably shouldn't go back there.]
[00:48:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Helring] Azacor is a wicked summoner who... who did some terrible things in the past, It's why I was stationed in the Grove while I was with the Axtans.
[00:48:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What can I do?]
[00:48:55] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Helring] We must investigate further. I need to know how he managed to cling on to this world. Furthermore, he still seems dangerous, even as a ghost. He had a mansion near the back of the grove where you may find out more.
[00:48:55] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'll go back and explore Azacor's mansion.]
[00:48:55] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I really don't want to go back.]
[00:49:03] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Helring] Thank you so much. I'll need to prepare... mentally... before returning to that place.

[00:49:15] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Outer Demons [1/2]: Find a way into Azacor's ritual room.
[00:49:17] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Outer Demons [2/2]: Find a way to get past the barrier in Azacor's ritual room.

[20:42:45] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You feel different. Perhaps you can get through the barrier in this room now.

[20:43:23] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Outer Demons: Open the mysterious chest past the barrier.

[20:43:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Azacor] Congratulations, you've gone from nuisance to problem. Looks like I'll need to deal with you more... personally.
[20:43:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Azacor] I'll show you just how much of a nightmare I can truly be.

Outer Demons: Escape from Azacor's trap in the Hallowed Hedge.

[20:44:54] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Azacor] No no, your torment is not quite over yet.

[20:45:07] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Outer Demons: Escape from Azacor's trap in the Whispering Woods.

[20:45:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Azacor] How about we clean you off a little.

[20:45:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Outer Demons: Escape from Azacor's trap in the Flooded Foyer.

[20:48:55] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Azacor] You are in my territory now.

[20:48:58] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Outer Demons: Escape from Azacor's trap in his mansion.

[20:49:10] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] As your vision goes black, you feel as if a hand is reaching out to you.
[20:49:10] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Helring] Oh thank goodness you are okay.

[20:49:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Outer Demons: Talk to Helring.

[20:49:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Helring] Thank goodness I found you Sukie, Azacor had you trapped in an Imprisonment Curse it seems.
[20:49:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Thank you for saving me!]
[20:49:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [You got here just in time!]
[20:49:39] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [This is getting serious, what's our next move?]
[20:49:45] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Helring] It's the least I could do. But we need to move fast, Azacor knows we're after him.
[20:49:45] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What's our next move?]
[20:49:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Helring] While looking for you I found Azacor's ritual room beneath the mansion as well, and it seems he was hiding the secret to his demise. We need to get to the Undergrowth to trap him in Ancient Wyrmwood.
[20:49:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [How does that work?]
[20:49:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Alright let's go.]
[20:50:07] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Helring] I've memorized the incantation to summon and trap Azacor, you just need to clear the way. Let's go!

[20:50:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Outer Demons: You need to trap Azacor in Ancient Wormwood in the Undergrowth. Get there and survive.

[20:56:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Azacor] I see you stumbled upon the source of the Wyrmwood. Of course, you don't really expect me to let you leave this location alive, do you?
[20:56:58] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Helring] Don't worry, I'm here to help! With the spell we found at his mansion we can bind Azacor to the Wyrmwood, and limit the damage he can bring to the Valley. Just keep him distracted for a little while!

[20:57:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Helring] I got him! The fiend is now bound to this sanctum!
[20:57:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Azacor] What foolish magic is this? No! You cannot keep me here forever! I will be unbound, and I shall destroy everything and everyone you care about! You will never rid the Valley of me!

[20:58:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Outer Demons: Talk to Helring.

[20:58:06] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Helring] We did it! Thank you for helping me put my past to rest. Azacor won't be able to cause trouble anymore, but he still isn't gone for good. Speak with me later and we can move forward with taking the fight to him.

[01:25:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [This isn't much of a fort.]
[01:25:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [That is a rather large telescope.]

[01:25:27] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Montana] Well it is a lot to ask of a stranger, but since you asked… My telescope broke in the move. A glass lens shattered and some of the other lenses are damaged beyond repair. I would get it repaired, but it would take ages for parts to arrive. Would you be willing to help me?

[01:25:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Montana] Wonderful! The only person I know that might have extra parts is an associate of mine in Nyr. Mayleen tends to hang out near her telescope. She shares my love of stars and we have worked together on projects for years.
[01:25:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I helped her fix her telescope recently.]
[01:25:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What type of projects?]
[01:25:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Do you have a list of parts?]
[01:26:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Montana] Nothing all that special really. In general we have done things since things are quite important. What is that look for? I gave you an answer. Fine... I occasionally do some glass blowing work with them. I'm a bit shy about it since I'm not that good at it. Actually, most of our interactions are glass themed now that I think about it.
[01:26:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Do you have a list of parts?]
[01:26:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Montana] Oh right, you need that don't you? Um, I don't really have any paper on me, but I need a decorative lens, a concave lens, and a convex lens. Mayleen will know what they are so you don't need to worry about the details.
[01:26:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I will head to Nyr as soon as possible.]

[01:27:57] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] Thank you for your help earlier! I can see a great many details now, a great many details indeed.
[01:27:57] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I am glad that I could help, but I need your help this time.]
[01:28:02] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] What seems to be the problem?

[01:28:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Montana needs help repairing her telescope.]
[01:28:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] She moved it to the top of a tree didn't she. I told her she was going to break something, but she wasn't in the mood to listen. Oh well, do you know what parts she needs?
[01:28:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [How do you know Montana?]
[01:28:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [She needs a decorative lens, a concave lens, and a convex lens.]
[01:28:21] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] We are old friends. We also do projects together at times. She has always been secretive around new people so I won't go into great detail, but I enjoy working with her even if she is a bit clumsy. We have a lot of paperwork though.
[01:28:21] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [She needs a decorative lens, a concave lens, and a convex lens.]
[01:28:31] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] I need to stay here, but I can help you find them. There are some lenses in the basement, but I am unsure of the type. The door is locked behind a puzzle that I don't know how to solve, but I know it is similar to my telescope's gearing system.
[01:28:31] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Got it, I'll get to work.]
[01:28:31] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [You can't get into your own storeroom?]
[01:28:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] This tower used to be a watchtower long before I got here. I saw some lenses down there when I was given the tour, but I never did work out how to get in there myself. Make all the lights face towards you, and the storeroom should unlock. Come back to me once you get the lens.

[01:28:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Starrier Night: Go to the basement and find the decorative lens. Remember to face all of the lights towards you.

[01:33:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You hear a lock opening. You should be able to get into the storeroom.

[01:33:50] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Starrier Night: Grab the decorative lens from the storeroom of Mayleen's tower and bring it back to Mayleen.

#Q26I01 https://puu.sh/GC9Ce/45a6a3a56b.png

[01:35:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] Good, you have the lens, and more importantly you opened my storeroom for me. Looks like that was a decorative lens, so you still need the functional ones. Before the Blackroot War a lookout tower was built east of Sierhaven. Unfortunately, after a tragedy the tower was abandoned. There might still be some supplies there.
[01:35:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Why would there be telescope parts there?]
[01:35:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Why was the tower abandoned?]
[01:35:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where is the tower?]
[01:35:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] The scouts in the tower failed to notice a Tlaxan Shaman approaching Sierhaven. That Tlaxan got into the capital, killed King Fluospar, and got out without being caught or spotted. After such failure the tower was shut down for political reasons.
[01:35:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where is the tower?]
[01:35:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] It is right outside of Sierhaven near a few fishing huts. If the plans I saw are to be believed, there is a secured bunker where they kept their extra supplies. Knowing the paranoia of the war they likely hid the entrance, and probably have some sort of lock on the bunker itself. I would check for an underwater entrance.
[01:35:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I will head there right away.]
[01:36:03] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] Hopefully everything she needs is there. I will have to make minor adjustments to anything you manage to find so come back here if you find anything.

[01:36:09] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Starrier Night: Head to the fishing huts east of Sierhaven and search underwater around the watchtower for a way into the basement. Make any lights you find face you.
2,2,3,3

[02:08:21] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You hear a door unlocking. You should be able to get into the bunker.

[02:08:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Starrier Night: Grab the concave lens from the chest in the fishing huts' watchtower's bunker and bring it back to Mayleen.

#Q26I02 https://puu.sh/GCa2i/589f1d2c29.png

[02:14:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] I see you found a concave lens. I'll fix that up quickly... There that should work. So you had no luck finding a convex lens?
[02:14:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [The roof collapsed in on the bunker.]
[02:14:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] So if there are any convex lens they are likely broken… Well that presents a slight problem. However it is possible that we can still get help. I recently spotted a telescope in a tower to the south. They might have extra supplies that could be used. It is a long shot, but might as well ask.
[02:14:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [So I need to talk to someone I don't know, that has no reason to help, that could try to kill me, and ask them for help?]
[02:14:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'll get right on it then!]
[02:15:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] Yup!
[02:15:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'll get right on it then!]
[02:15:15] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] Be careful, I don't know anything about the owner of that telescope. I have a bad feeling about them. If it gets dangerous, leave right away. I don't want to be responsible for your death.

[02:15:21] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Starrier Night: Talk to the owner of the tower to the south of Nyr and ask for a convex lens.

[02:17:24] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Gaius] Who are you and why are you here? Nevermind, I really don't care. Leave or I will have to make you leave.

[02:21:07] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] I have one, but it is a long shot. Telescopes need light to work, as you saw when you adjusted my gearing system. If you were to “reconfigure” his gearing system to direct the light towards him, he might not know how to fix it. If we are lucky he might even put his anger to good use and destroy his own equipment. You will most likely find their gearing system in their basement.

[02:21:23] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] You are too focused on the goal, where is your sense of adventure? You should have more than enough time to take the lens from them while they are trying to figure out why it isn't working. After that return to me like always.

[02:21:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Starrier Night: Find a way into Gaius's basement and break his telescope. Try making all the lights face away from you.

[02:24:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Gaius] Why is this piece of junk not working. My boss isn't going to be happy with me. Maybe if I keep hitting it.
[02:24:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What seems to be the problem?]
[02:24:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [(Steal the lens while he is occupied.)]
[02:24:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Gaius] I have told you to leave several times now. If I find out that you were responsible for breaking this, you won't live to regret it.
[02:24:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [(Steal the lens while he is occupied.)]
[02:24:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You successfully snatch a lens out of the telescope. Head back to Mayleen.
[02:24:57] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Gaius] Now is really not a good time. If you don't leave I will be forced to take out all my anger on you instead of this telescope.
[02:24:57] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [(Steal another lens while he is blinded by rage)]
[02:25:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You successfully snatch another lens. You should probably leave now.

[02:25:13] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Starrier Night: You've got the convex lens from Gaius! Bring it back to Mayleen.

[02:26:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] From the look on your face I assume you got the lens?
[02:26:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Yes I got it, can you modify it for me?]
[02:26:54] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Mayleen] Let me see that lens for just a second… Okay it should be ready. That guy over there is doing a number on his telescope, I would be shocked if it ever gets repaired. I can't say that makes me all that upset. You should be ready to return to Montana now.

[02:27:03] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Starrier Night: You have all three lenses! Bring them back to Montana. You can find the decorative lens in Mayleen's storeroom.

[02:28:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Montana] Welcome back! Have you had any luck finding any of the parts I need?
[02:28:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I found a decorative glass lens.]

[02:28:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> [FISH] EmilyVEVO » why dont the groots answer me
[02:28:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Montana] Nice, I'll install it right away. While it is only decorative it just feels wrong using a telescope without it.
[02:28:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Montana] Have you found any of the other parts I need?
[02:28:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I found a concave lens.]
[02:28:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I had a part but I lost it.]
[02:29:01] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Montana] The negative power of this lens should help balance color errors, well it will once paired with a convex lens at least.
[02:29:01] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Montana] Any chance that you also have the last part I need?
[02:29:01] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I found a convex lens.]

[02:29:04] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Montana] I'm positive that this will help counter the negativity of the concave lens.
[02:29:04] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Montana] Looks like that is all of them. I already configured the gears while I was waiting for you to get back so everything should be set up now. I can't thank you enough for what you have done for me. I will have to send Mayleen a thank you note as well.
[02:29:04] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I can deliver it if you want.]
