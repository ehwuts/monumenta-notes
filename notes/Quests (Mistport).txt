==Master of One==
[The Teacher] Well hello, you must be Sukie. I have been anticipating your arrival.
[You have?]
[The Teacher] Yes, it was only logical you would end up here eventually. I knew it would happen.
[So why were you waiting for me?]
[That's a tad creepy.]
[The Teacher] You see, the building you passed through on your way here once housed a great school, one where people of all trades could come and hone their skills to new heights. I wish to rebuild that school, but I require some assistance.
[How can I help?]
[No thanks.]
[The Teacher] Let's start with some rather... hard-to-come-by materials. In Alnera, there is a blacksmith who is famous across the world as the only able to create creating Crystallized Iron. Likewise, in Frostgate, an expert artisan is the only known crafter of Wisperwood Stakes. I require you to fetch these for me- they are of the utmost importance to my task.
QUEST : Master of One
Length : Short-Medium
Difficulty : Medium
Assist the Teacher in rebuilding the school of Mistport.

Master of One [1/2]: Search out a blacksmith in Alnera that can produce crystallized iron.
Master of One [2/2]: You also need to find an artisan in Frostgate who can provide wisperwood stakes.

[Artisan Angra] Hello there, are you looking for anything specific today? Some crafted displays, or maybe a polished table?
[I think I'm good right now.]
[I was sent to ask you about a Wisperwood Stake.]
[Artisan Angra] Oh my, I haven't made one of those in years. That trade started dying when the wood became endangered. I'm the only one left that can even still make them, though I won't hurt that species any more than I already have.
[I need one for a mission I have in Mistport.]
[Artisan Angra] Mistport?! No no no, listen, I don't want any trouble with pirates. I moved to Frostgate to get away from them.
[I'm not going to hurt-]
[Artisan Angra] Here look, I have a single one still in my drawer that I keep to remember the old days. You can take it, but please just leave.

#Q103I02 https://puu.sh/GDRWh/37db894587.png

[Blacksmith Ghalla] I don't really have much time to talk. Got a lot of orders to fill today.
[I was sent to ask you about some Crystallized Iron.]
[22:58:52] [main/WARN]: Unknown custom packed identifier: venturechat:data
[Blacksmith Ghalla] You and every other person in the world. Listen, if you want a weapon, you'll need to place an order like everyone else.
[I don't want a weapon, I was just sent to get some iron for Mistport.]
[Blacksmith Ghalla] WHAT? Mistport? Damn that Xeno, we had a deal- stay away from me and my iron mines and I'll prioritize his end-of-month requests.
[I'm not here with-]
[Blacksmith Ghalla] You know what, I don't have time to stress about this. Here, take some that was just made, and get out.

#Q103I01 https://puu.sh/GDSOW/d915a54e94.png

[The Teacher] Ahh yes, both of these are perfect. They will do just nicely.
The Teacher slides both items into his drawer.
[How do these things help us with the rebuilding the school?]
[The Teacher] These? Ohoh no no, that's not what these are for. No, they will come in handy much later; but don't worry too much about that.
[You said they were essential for building the school.]
[The Teacher] No, I believe I said they were essential for my task. You see, there was a lesson to learn here. What did you notice about the two individuals you visited?
[They were the only ones who could produce these items.]
[The Teacher] Precisely. You see, things are different here in the Isles than the are in the Valley. What you experienced today were individuals who are masters in their trades.
[The Teacher] The line doesn't draw there though. No, far from it. There are people who take their skills even higher: Specialists, you might say. And this is the crown jewel of knowledge: getting one of them to share their experience with you. So, for your final task, go find one of these specialists. Do what it takes to learn about their skills, and return to me with the knowledge you gained.

Master of One: Go out into the world and find a specialization master, and then return to the Teacher with the knowledge you learn from them.


You should probably head back to the Teacher in Mistport to tell him of the knowledge you've learned here.

Master of One: Talk to the Teacher.

[The Teacher] Ahh, I sense you are much wiser than the last time we spoke! You found a master, didn't you? Please, tell me about your time with them.
You tell the teacher about your adventure.
[00:51:46] [main/INFO]: Loaded 498 advancements
[The Teacher] I see! How fascinating; I would never have even considered that! Very well, I shall do what needs to be done to remake that building into the great school it once was. That said, your assistance is still needed. I sense that there are still many more masters out there in the world. Search them out and continue to learn what they teach. From that, we may further expand our data bank of knowledge.
MASTER OF ONE COMPLETE!
Awarded a Skill Specialization Point, access to Specialization Trials, access to Skill Specializations, and 1 Prestige.

==Fishy Business==

[Lincoln] Ugh, this client again? Why does he always order so many rare fish? It's such a pain...
[Hello!]
[Hello crazy person talking to himself!]
He's talking to himself.
<G> [FISH] TheCrusader57 » Dreadful feels like a cakewalk after having to deal with relentless
[Lincoln] Are you here to order something annoying too?
[No, I was just stopping by to see if you needed anything.]
[Yes, I'll have two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda.]
[Lincoln] Oh, I see. Why yes- you see this client I have is looking for some pain-in-the-arse-to-fetch fish. And I know exactly where to find it...the Sunken Ship to the southwest. This species of Salmon love to hide in wrecks. 
QUEST : Fishy Business

#Q125I01 https://puu.sh/GDC1J/f2342b7e4c.png

Fishy Business [1/2]: Return to Lincoln with the Salmon.
Fishy Business [2/2]: If you lose the Salmon you can find another at the Sunken Ship.

[Lincoln] It's simple: just deliver the fish to my client! He should be in the park in front of the Brig.
He rubs his hands together excitedly.

Fishy Business [1/2]: Deliver the Salmon to the client by the Mistport Brig.
Fishy Business [2/2]: If you lose the Salmon you can find another at the Sunken Ship.

[Alton] I hope my delivery comes soon- I was looking to cook up something fishy for dinner tonight...
[Why yes, your delivery has come!]
[Alton] Ah! Perfect! I assume you've brought the fish?
[Yep, here it is.]
[Alton] Hmm... It looks a little odd for a salmon, but I'm sure it'll taste just fine! I trust Lincoln. Give him my thanks!

Fishy Business: Return to Lincoln.

[Lincoln] Have you delivered the fish?
[Yes, I have! Alton seems quite pleased- he was looking forward to having it for dinner.]
[Lincoln] Perfect! Now I'll never have to deal with him again!
He looks at you nervously.
[Excuse me?]

==A Sunken Feeling==
[Cropmaster Afondo] Six hundred and eighty-six thousand gallons... Six months of crops lost... How are we- Oh hello. I didn't see you there.
[Are you okay?]
[Hi! How are you?]
[Cropmaster Afondo] Not in the slightest. We have a saboteur in our midst!
[A saboteur? Oh no!]
[Oh, that sucks.]
[Well, good luck dealing with that!]
[Cropmaster Afondo] Oh no indeed. The farm that feeds Mistport has been completely flooded, and our crops have been ruined!
[Can I help?]
[I wish I could help, but I'm rather busy right now.]
[Cropmaster Afondo] Would you? I don't even know where to begin right now, but any help would be... it would be quite a weight off my back.
QUEST : A SUNKEN FEELING
Length : Short
Difficulty : Easy
Help Afondo deal with the flooded farm and find the saboteur!
[Cropmaster Afondo] I'll need to let you into the flooded farm, but you can't go in with any items. The water will destroy them entirely!
[Why?]
[Cropmaster Afondo] The fertilizer down there really doesn't like most metals, see. Better safe than sorry, aye.
[What do I do while I'm down there?]
[Cropmaster Afondo] There are three drains in the Farm that you'll need to find, and see what the damage is. There will also be three chests - they will have specific Coral Dissolvers in them. Whomever SABOTAGED the Farm used coral, so you'll need to use the Dissolvers to destroy the coral and let the Farm drain!
[What do I do with the Coral Dissolvers?]
[Where do I find the drains?]
[I'm ready to go!]
<G> [Fox] Fwap_a_Durp » yay for anvil trades
<G> [Fox] Fwap_a_Durp » now my anvils stack :D
[Cropmaster Afondo] Look for a smaller block of coral floating near the drain. That'll be the brain. Use the Coral Dissolver on it and you'll begin the process!

A Sunken Feeling: Talk to Cropmaster Afondo

[Cropmaster Afondo] Head inside, into the water. Find Coral Dissolvers for the specific coral you need to dissolve, blocking the three drains. Find the small floating coral, the brain, and use the dissolver on it. Once all three brains have been dissolved, return to me, and the Farm should begin draining.

[Fire Coral] Now listen here, I'm trying to take a nap.
[B-blubbb-AHH!!!-blubbbbbb]
[Fire Coral] Oh, pardon my manners. You thought I was a fire coral, didn't you?
[B-bbllllubahhhhblub]
[Fire Coral] Of course, I understand. I am no coral. I am a Nereid. I found this lovely Farm and thought it'd be much better with my presence.
[B-BLUBBBUBBBB]
[Fire Coral] What? I killed all the crops? Well, dangnabbit. I'm so sorry, chap. Let me just... take that dissolver and I'll get out of here... It seemed fun at the time to flood this place!
The Nereid seems to fade into the background, and the coral begins to slowly dissolve.

A Sunken Feeling: Tell Afondo the good news.

[Cropmaster Afondo] How did it go down there, Sukie?
[I've got all three coral brains dissolved, Cropmaster, Sir!]
[Cropmaster Afondo] You're very right, you hero, you! The Farm has already begun draining! Now we begin the mystery of the saboteur...
[Actually, I've got an answer for that one as well.]
[Cropmaster Afondo] Say what now?
[The Fire Coral blocking a drain down there turned out not to be a Coral at all. It was a trickster Nereid.]
[Cropmaster Afondo] W-WHAT?! HOW DARE THEY! WE HAVE A TREATY WITH THOSE BASTARDS, YOU KNOW THAT? Why, I'll be taking this right up with the Pirate Council immediately... Crops ruined... gah!
[At least they're gone now.]
[Cropmaster Afondo] That be true, they are gone. I'm STILL BRINGING THIS UP WITH THE COUNCIL THOUGH. Gah, blasted Nereids. Everyone thinks they're great, until they run a nasty trick on you. Seriously, Sukie. This is SIX MONTHS of crops wasted.
[That's a ton.]
[Just six months?]
[Cropmaster Afondo] YES IT IS. GAH! ...Well, anywho. You did me a massive favor down there, friend. I think it's time I did one back for you. I've got this splendid item I want you to have, as thanks. Additionally, you can come check out the Farm as we recover whenever you like. How's that sound?

==Raiding Party==
[Levyn] Arrgh! Mistport is where all of my dreams come true! What can I do for my favorite matey?
[What's there to do here?]
[What does it mean now that we've agreed to join the Mistport pirates?]
[Where is Captain Indigo?]
[Where is Izzy?]
[Where is Samwell?]
[Levyn] Arr, there's plenty! There be an academy, shops to peruse, outposts to raid, and even a place to repair yer gear. I've... not explored this place enough yet though. The beer here is too good!

[What does it mean now that we've agreed to join the Mistport pirates?]
[Where is Captain Indigo?]
[Where is Izzy?]
[Where is Samwell?]
[Levyn] It seems that right now we are merely on probation, we need to prove we can pillage and plunder like the rest of 'em. One of the esteemed pirates, Captain Lamis, over on the docks, is puttin' together a raid. You should go see him about joining the raid so we can prove our worth.

[Captain Lamis] Arrgh so you're one of those pirates from King's Valley? I suppose I have heard word of you in my travels. Somethin' about some Children of the Trees and collectin' five colored sheep.
[Y'Arrgh that be me.]
[Captain Lamis] Arrgh Captain Indigo was right, you really are pretty bad at talkin' like a pirate. Listen here, I'm puttin' together a raid on some Viridian outposts. If ye and your mateys tag along and prove your worth, I may be able to convince the rest of the town to accept ye as full-fledged members of our upstandin' community. Do ye want in?
[Count us in!]
[Who's to say this will earn us a place here?]
[Perhaps later.]
[Captain Lamis] Arrgh that's what I like to hear!
QUEST: RAIDING PARTY

Difficulty: Easy
Go on a Raid for treasure and impress the Mistport pirates.
[Captain Lamis] Now! Fer yer first raid! Ye must sail with yer crew to the mighty Barracks at Sea, nor'east of this here town and find the supply drop I've been promised. I sent Levyn there ahead of you, so you should probably look for him. Bring it back ta' me and prove yer worth! Any questions?
[What will I find there?]
[From whose barracks am I stealing from?]
[Do have you any stories of your prior adventures?]
[Captain Lamis] Stealing? Nah, this be no stealing. Yer picking up a shipment. You'll be findin' remnants of the fallen Viridian Empire there though, so be on yer guard!

[Do have you any stories of your prior adventures?]
[Captain Lamis] Be on the lookout for guardians of the depths! These islands used ta' be the Viridian Empire, bafore it fell fer reasons we dunno.

Raiding Party: Travel to the Barracks at Sea and find Levyn to get a supply cache for Captain Lamis.

[Levyn] Ahoy Sukie! I can spot the supply cache we need on the other side of this vault door, but we're going to have to be creative to get past it.
[What do you have in mind?]
[Levyn] Explosives of course! But only the best TNT will do. Could ye go up into the barracks and grab some high quality TNT? I've seen some lying around. There must be more!
[Aye aye.]
[Levyn] Arrgh! I'll be here waitin' for ye.

Raiding Party [1/2]: Find the Best TNT Ever!
Raiding Party [2/2]: Talk to Levyn at the Barracks at Sea once you have the Best TNT Ever.

#Q102I01 https://puu.sh/GDL7k/3c64970249.png

[Levyn] Arrgh you've done it! Now stand back.
[Stand back from what?]

Raiding Party [1/2]: Grab the supply cache from inside the vault near Levyn at the Barracks at Sea.
Raiding Party [2/2]: Return the cache to Captain Lamis,

#Q102I02 https://puu.sh/GDL8U/3551e8e5a5.png

[Captain Lamis] Arrgh next ye need to take yer crew to the Skull Island, just to the east of here. There be two caches there, but me mateys have heard rumblings of trouble. Ye really need to be on yer guard. I sent Samwell and Izzy there ahead of you. Any questions?
[What will we be expecting there?]
[Do you have any more stories to tell?]
[Captain Lamis] There be a series of forts and I think there be a big underground section. Ye can stay outta there - me mates won't go too deep.

Raiding Party [1/3]: Head to Skull Island and find Samwell to aid the search for one of the two caches for Captain Lamis. Watch out for trouble.

Raiding Party [3/3]: Once you have the caches, return to Captain Lamis.

[Samwell] Aha! One of those mirages dropped some treasure! I would celebrate more if we didn't have to give it to that greedy pirate Lamis. Here, take it back to Mistport along with Izzy's cache.

#Q102I04 https://puu.sh/GDMiU/25577362c9.png

[Izzy] Ahoy Sukie. These tomes are actually quite interesting. But, we're here to find a supply cache to prove we can be pirates or whatever, and for that I need some help with this mechanism here.

[Izzy] It seems that, in order to open up the locked room where the cache is, we need to guess the correct order to light up all of the lamps. Give it a shot.

[Izzy] You did it. Just grab the cache from inside that room up there and bring it to Lamis back at Mistport, with Samwell's cache.

[Captain Lamis] Amazing! Ye did it all! Arrgh we need to head to the pub for a bottle o' rum. Care to join me?
[Y'Arrgh.]
[N'Arrgh.]
[Captain Lamis] Arrgh!

Raiding Party [1/2]: Enjoy the party, in your crew's honor! When you're all partied out, chat with Captain Indigo.
Raiding Party [2/2]: Should you somehow leave the party early talk to Captain Lamis to return to it.

[Izzy] Well done Sukie, but, to be honest, I don't know how much pirating I want to do anymore. I'm getting a bit tired of it.

[Captain Indigo] Good job Sukie. I'm not sure the rest of the crew could've pulled through without your help. If it hasn't been said already, you've definitely grown into piracy since we first met.

#Q106I02 https://puu.sh/GE9cq/799626cde2.png

[Izzy] Oh my... This could complicate things quite a bit...
Izzy takes the items you found, and examines them.
[What's the matter?]
[Izzy] Okay, focus... 
[Izzy] Each of these are items that come from the upper echelons of the Celsian governments. A seal from the Pharaoh of Ishnir, and a totem from the Church of Chillwind... If Vargos' apprentice got himself on the wrong foot with either of these entities, we might be out of luck.
[So what do we do?]
<G> [WAIFU] KarlStrauss » for 1 hcs
[Izzy] Well for starters, we are going to need some evidence. While these items may seem incriminating, I highly doubt the two governments would have put aside their differences just to kill a young man from the Valley. It's more than likely that only one is responsible, and one is being framed.
[Sounds like it's time for an investigation.]
<G> [WAIFU] Dayablep » what
<G> [WAIFU] KarlStrauss » it's worth
[Izzy] Indeed. I suggest that we put our focus on one kingdom at a time, however- which one do you think we should look into first?
[The Ishnir Empire.]
[The Church of Chillwind.]

[Izzy] Very well then, we shall look into the Church of Chillwind and the Queen's involvement first. If you wish to switch who we are investigating, you can talk to me later.
[Izzy] Now, the closest information we might be able to get on this Totem without looking too suspicious is with one of lower members of the Church, such as a Deacon. One can likely be found in the cathedral in Frostgate, the capital city of the Chillwind.

The Wizard's Apprentice: Seek out Deacon Duncan in Frostgate's cathedral

[Deacon Duncan] Oh lord, who sits on high, we beg thee for thy mercy...
He seems to be very deep in prayer.
[Um, excuse me... Do you have a moment?]
[Deacon Duncan] Huh? Oh, welcome child. How can I be of service to you and your place in life today?
[I was looking to ask you about a Holy Totem.]
[Deacon Duncan] What of them?
[Could you tell me about what they are used for?]
[19:39:04] [main/WARN]: Unknown custom packed identifier: venturechat:data
[Deacon Duncan] Yes, well-
A loud shriek comes from the back of the building, interrupting Deacon Duncan.
[Deacon Duncan] Oh no, not again... My child, I must ask you for a favor. Could you go down to the catacombs below the cathedral and take care of the undead whoever-it-is this time? I will talk to you more about the Totem later.
[You are making this sound like it's a normal occurrence.]
[Deacon Duncan] Far more frequent than I care to admit. As a word of advice: never perform an exorcism on a poultrygeist. You will never live it down.
[19:39:22] [main/WARN]: Unknown custom packed identifier: venturechat:data

The Wizard's Apprentice: Deacon Duncan needs your help in clearing out some undead in the cathedral's catacombs.

As the undead paladin falls defeated, you feel the area come to peace. Best let Deacon Duncan know that it's been dealt with.

The Wizard's Apprentice: Return to Deacon Duncan

[Deacon Duncan] Oh lord, who sits on high, we beg thee for thy mercy...
He seems to be very deep in prayer.
[Are you... already praying again?]
[Deacon Duncan] Yes, well, a servant of the lord is always in prayer. I assume the undead creatures have been taken care of?
[They are.]

[Deacon Duncan] Fantastic. Now what were we speaking of?
[The Holy Totem.]
[Deacon Duncan] Ah, right. The Holy Chillwind Totems are possessions of the Holy Royal Advisor, Ridnan. As he travels the land, gaining experience in order to better service the Queen, he leaves them behind as blessings to the places he visits. They are mementos, if nothing else. If you have any specific questions about them, you could ask him directly. He's usually over in the castle, giving advice to the Queen.

[Actually, I needed to discuss the death of a young man in Mistport with you.]
[Royal Advisor Ridnan] I am the Holy Royal Advisor to the Queen, though you may refer to me as simply Ridnan if you wish.

[Care to explain why one of your Totems was found with the man's body then?]
[Royal Advisor Ridnan] I'm sorry? Surely you must be mistaken. I just arrived back into town yesterday after a long journey from Nightroost. If you are searching for an alibi, you may go there and search near the Royal Reserve. There, you will truly see one of my totems as a sign that I was there.

[Izzy] Welcome back Sukie. How has your investigation in Chillwind gone?
[I learned the truth about the death of Vargos' apprentice.]
[Izzy] Oh? Do tell.
[Xeno hired a man in Nightroost to steal the Totem and frame Chillwind. He's behind this.]
[Izzy] What?! What could Xeno be up to here? Is he trying to start a war between the Valley and the Isles? We need to find more information on what his endgame is here. Try sneaking aboard his ships on the dock and see if you can find anything.

The Wizard's Apprentice [1/2]: Sneak onto Xeno's ship and see if you can find anything of note.

[Izzy] Did you find anything?
[I only found this, whatever it is.]
Izzy takes the crystal and examines it a bit.
[Izzy] What even is this thing? This was on his ship?
[It was in his captain's quarters, yes.]
Izzy taps on the crystal gently.
[Izzy] Uh, what's happening?
[Izzy] This can't be good...

[Xeno] The sea... Isn't it beautiful from here? My own personal cove.
[Masked Saboteur] Cut the small talk, Xeno. I know you didn't call me here just to watch the waves.
[Xeno] No, I suppose not. I simply wanted to inform you that the deed is done. That wizard's little boy is gone, and all signs lead to the kingdoms.
[Masked Saboteur] And that usurper, Sukie? What of them?
[Xeno] That's less of my concern, and more of yours. If Sukie decides to get in my way, I'll crush them myself. But, until then, my part of the agreement has been settled. Now I expect your boss to carry his end as well.

[Izzy] Well that was... definitely something.
[I think that confirms our suspicions.]
[Izzy] Definitely. Xeno is plotting something, and we need to figure out what.
[What do we do now?]
[Izzy] My plan is to get this crystal into working order. If we can properly use it, it could help us get more insight into what he's up to. It's going to take some time though.

[Izzy] Hello Sukie, glad you are still doing okay.
[How's work on the crystal going?]
[Izzy] Still trying to figure the stupid thing out. I've made some progress, but it's going to take a bit more time. Historian Rhodes, across the street, has been discussing his research with me though. Maybe give him a chat?

[Historian Rhodes] You're the adventurer from King's Valley, right?
[That's me!]
[Arrgh no I be a pirate arrgh.]
[Historian Rhodes] Wonderful! You're just the person I've been looking for. Izzy has told me that you're much more civilized than these pirate-y folk.
[You know Izzy?]
[Historian Rhodes] That I do! Izzy is just across the way after all- he seems to share a love of research that these otherwise vile pirates tend not to have. To the matter at hand though- tell me, have you heard of the Viridian Empire?
[Of course I have.]
[No, I haven't.]
<G> P0lar_Cat » im talking about optifine
[Historian Rhodes] Well let's have a quick history lesson then. A few centuries ago, there used to be three kingdoms in the Celsian Isles: the Chillwind kingdom, the Ishnir kingdom, and the Viridian Empire. The Viridian Empire was younger than the other two, yet also much more advanced technologically. The leader of the Viridian Empire, Salazar the Great, propelled the nation forward with an uncanny intuition and incredible intellect. Then, almost suddenly, the empire fell. It was quite secluded, so the reason for the fall can only be guessed. These pirates here figured out that the fallen empire left behind quite a bit of treasure, so they prowl the region for long, lost valuables. So, tell me: would you like to go on an adventure with me to find it?
[Count me in.]
[My quest compass is pretty full right now, so I'll come back later.]
<G> insunu » yes open with java
[Historian Rhodes] Brilliant! We best get moving then. I'll need to gather some supplies but you can get a head start by exploring the sewers for a way into the empire ruins. Izzy tells me a crewman of yours has been setting up camp down there, go check if he's seen anything.
QUEST: THE LOST EMPIRE
Length: Medium
Difficulty: Easy

The Lost Empire: Search out Samwell in the sewers.

[Samwell] Hi Sukie. There's suprisingly so many things to stumble upon in these sewers. Whirlpools, moss, even a black market if you go deep enough. Reminds me of home.
[Have you seen any hints of some old ruins down here?]
[Samwell] Ruins? In the sewers? Are you finally going on an adventure for treasure?!
[There will probably be treasure.]
[I don't think there will be any treasure.]
WhyAmIPlayingMC joined the game
[Samwell] FINALLY! Yeah, I saw something suspicious down this tunnel: an odd sort of whirlpool that goes down into a lit room. If you're brave enough to jump in, I'll follow you.

The Lost Empire: Head into the deeper parts of the sewers and search out an entrance to the old ruins.

[Historian Rhodes] Well done finding this place! You've already proven your value on this team. That room over there looks packed to the brim with books and knowledge- we just need to get in.
[How do you propose we get in?]
[What is this place?]
[How do we leave?]
[Historian Rhodes] These doorways seem to be locked off with some magical barriers. There appears to be these fonts in a few of the rooms. If I had to guess, I assume certain combinations of active and inactive fonts will open the doors. That said, the doors likely act independently, and will probably require different combinations per door.

[Historian Rhodes] Well done finding this place! You've already proven your value on this team. That room over there looks packed to the brim with books and knowledge- we just need to get in.
[How do you propose we get in?]
[What is this place?]
[How do we leave?]
[Historian Rhodes] The architecture is definitely that of the Viridian Empire, but as to exactly what it was, I'm unsure. These magical barriers are definitely excessive though, if their only purpose is to keep people out of that study.

goal is 346?

[Historian Rhodes] This is amazing! Look at all of this knowledge collected in one place. We can learn so much about the Viridian Empire from it.
[Samwell] And look at all of this treasure! All of the gold. Finally; we'll be rich!
[Historian Rhodes] This chart here is quite interesting. It almost looks like... I think this is a map to the capital city of the empire!
[Samwell] More treaure you say? Well, might as well take as much as we can from here before we set off for the capital.

[First Mate Jones] Well, from what I overheard earlier, it sounds like this is only the tip of the iceberg. I'll tell you what: we'll get you out of there if you bring us to this Viridian capital. Deal?
[Historian Rhodes] It's not like we have much of a choice. Deal.

[Historian Rhodes] Well this hasn't gone well at all. You'd better speak with Jones behind my house here so we can set sail for the Viridian Empire capital.

[First Mate Jones] Finally, ye 'ave shown up- I was about to send some men to bring ye here. Well, let's not dilly-dally- are ye ready to set sail to find a mountain of treasure? This ain't be a charity: ye will have to make your way back there yeself if you run away.

[Why would we be partners?]

[How do you know there's a wool in there?]
[Captain Xeno] Let's just say I have my sources. But never mind that: I've come personally to offer it to you.
[What's the catch?]
[Captain Xeno] The catch? It's nothing major, I promise you. I simply ask that you pave the way through the city and leave some spoils to us. We're just here for the treasure, nothing more.
[That sounds fair. Deal.]
[Samwell] Seriously?! You're going to give up the treasure to him for some stupid wool?
[We have to. We need to retrieve the wool.]
[Samwell] Well if that's your decision, then I'm out. I came here to get rich, not to do what's right. Xeno, do you have any room on your crew for one more?

[This is definitely one of Xeno's hideouts, and he plans to meet with the man who attacked us again.]

[Izzy] I figured such a thing was inevitable- they seem to be working quite closely together. Any idea where they might be meeting?
[In the south west slime ocean. They must have a meeting location there.]
[Izzy] Interesting... I seem to remember that portion of the ocean being particularly islandless, if the maps are correct. I can't imagine where they could be meeting. That said, we should probably get our crew into full order before barging in. Are you ready to head back to Mistport?
[Let's go.]
[No, I want to look around a little longer.]
[Izzy] Alright, switching the crystal to return mode.

Xenophobia: Speak to Captain Indigo.

[Izzy] We need to prepare our crew before heading out. It's likely best to start with Indigo- she'll need to hear where we are going so she can prepare the ship for departure.

[Captain Indigo] Hello Sukie, how are the Isles faring you?
[Izzy and I found some information on Xeno and the man who attacked us. ]
[Captain Indigo] Oh? Well that is news. Is there any action we can take?
[We need to sail into the south western region of the ocean, they are meeting there.]
[Captain Indigo] I see, I'll make the necessary preparations, then. But what of Samwell and Levyn? I've not heard from them in some time.
[Samwell left the crew to join Xeno. Last I saw Levyn, he was down and believed he's not fit to be a pirate.]
[Captain Indigo] *sigh* We picked a real crew there, didn't we. I suppose we can forget about Samwell then, but we need Levyn, especially if you aren't entirely sure where we are heading in the south west. If there's anyone who can get information out of pirates, it's him. While I prep the ship, try to go talk some sense into him.

[I... can't believe it. Levyn, you actually did it.]
[Levyn] Arrgh! I feel the pirate spirit returning to me! I can do this!
[Now, for the information.]
[Levyn] [Salty Bartender] I er... I can't... Cap'in Xeno will 'ave me 'ead.
[Levyn] Arrgh! You will, or the beer you drank won't be the only thing lose.

Xenophobia [1/2]: Speak to Captain Indigo.
Xenophobia [2/2]: Search out Xeno's underwater hideout.

[Levyn] Arrgh! Let's head over to Indigo! I'm feeling more like a pirate than ever before!

[Captain Indigo] I'm going to take Levyn losing his lunch over the side of the dock just now as a good sign.
[He seems to be back in working order, and we got some exact coordinates.]
<G> [DAD] forte_927 » you say that until the water miniboss 2 shots us
[Captain Indigo] Fantastic! Where are we heading?
[324 notches south, 125 notches west]
[Captain Indigo] That sounds doable. I'm all prepared and Izzy is communicating with someone below deck using some magic doohickey. That said, we should be all set and can voyage out as soon as you are ready.
[Let's go!]
[I'm not quite ready.]
[Captain Indigo] Ahoy!

[Captain Indigo] As I figured, nothing seems to be around here. If Xeno really is here, they likely have an underwater base somewhere. It's probably best for you to scout ahead Sukie. We'll be right behind you.

[Captain Xeno] Now there, what seems to have gotten you in such a fuss?
[Masked Saboteur] You are well aware of the issue. We gave you the information on the city so that you could find the Wool, not sell it out to that wretch, Sukie.
[Captain Xeno] Oh come now, you've known since the start of our business agreement that I've only ever been out for wealth. That is the only true power in this world- opportunity. Your balls of sheep hair mean nothing to me.
[Masked Saboteur] You ignorant fool, you have no idea of the repercussions of your act-
[Masked Saboteur] You! I thought I would have to hunt you down like the vermin you are, but you've just come right to me. This time, I'm going to finish you off!
[Indigo] Sukie, we're right behind you! Izzy, you help him out. Levyn, come with me. We can't let Xeno escape in the madness!

[Mysterious Man] Oh, I'm sure you probably could. You are a constant pain, after all.

[Izzy] You should speak with Vargos. I'm sure there's plenty he needs to tell you.

[Vargos] Well, that was a close one. If Izzy hadn't have contacted me, you guys would have been goners for sure.
[Vargos?!]
[Vargos] It's good to see you again, Sukie. I apologize that it had to be on such odd circumstances.
[What just happened?]
[Vargos] You were about to be killed, that's what. He's finally made his move. I knew he was here in the Isles somewhere, but finding him was almost impossible. Especially after he had my apprentice killed.
[Wait, so that man... He was...]
[Vargos] Yes; the man you saw- that was Calder. He's the one Xeno has been working with. And, from what Izzy told me, he was attempting to get the kingdoms into a political war with the Valley.
[What do we do now?]
[Vargos] Honestly, I'm not entirely sure. Calder is calculating and cunning- it will be hard to predict his next move. For now, I suppose we wait.
[I suppose so.]
[Vargos] In the meantime, your pirate friend Levyn went screaming into the bar. You might wanna go check that he's okay.

Xenophobia: Speak with Levyn in the bar.

[Levyn] Arrgh! Sukie, you won't believe it! The town is growing hastey now that they know Xeno is dead. Riots are going to come!
[What can we do about it?]
[Salty Bartender] Zehahaha! What can ye do abert it, ye say? Any crew be in an uproar when ther cap'in be gone. A new cap'in need to rise in to fill teh slot.
[Levyn] Arrgh! The town needs a new captain. Sukie, it has to be you!
[Why me?]
[Levyn] Arrgh! Because you're the best pirate that ever sailed! You took care of that masked guy, twice! Let me spread the word for you! I can talk these pirates into it.
[Salty Bartender]: Zehahaha! And while we be startin' on the wrong foot back wit me booze machine, ye did a wonderful job makin' it. Me swill 'as been the best booze I ever did drink.

==The Foreign Soldier==

[Vargos] Ah, hello again Sukie! Your timing is quite convenient, I was just speaking to Izzy about you.
[Have you found more information on Calder?]
[I'm sorry about your apprentice.]
SirTudor joined the game
[Vargos] Yes, Soran was a great student. It's a shame that his life was cut far too short, but his death will not be in vain. Calder will get his recompense soon enough. 
[Vargos] Ah, hello again Sukie! Your timing is quite convenient, I was just speaking to Izzy about you.
[Have you found more information on Calder?]
[I'm sorry about your apprentice.]
[Vargos] Unfortunately no. We have a few leads, but nothing conclusive yet. However, we do still need you for something in the meantime.
[What is it?]
[Izzy] Our reports suggest that both Ishnir and Chillwind royals have gotten word of the exchange of power here in Mistport. That is to say, they've likely got their eyes on you.
[That seems bad.]
[Izzy] Not quite. We could use this as a good opportunity to understand a bit more about the war. Given how much we have to watch our actions due to the conflicts between the nations, we still understand suprisingly little about what those conflicts are over. It's a tense situation, and the smallest action from either side could lead to actual bloodshed.
[So you want me to investigate the war?]
[Vargos] Indeed. We need you get close with some of the more influential citizens of the Isles, those who likely hold information not publicly known. How does that sound to you?
[I'll do it.]
[Not right now.]
[Vargos] Fantastic! I've had our sources compile a list of people who might be the best targets. Seek them out, and see what information you can extract from them.

[The firing range? You're aiming at the ocean!]
[General Arne] That we are! Can't do much damage to the surrounding areas if we fire out into the ocean, now can we?
[I guess I can't argue with that.]
[General Arne] Say, are you busy right now? You seem like you know your way around a complicated firing mechanism. We are down a man today and could really use some help with setup.
[What do you need me to do?]
[General Arne] Well, the trebuchet's mechanisms have gone a bit crazy today and need a manual reset. Unfortunately, I can't reset it myself, as someone needs to stand up here and check all the moving parts as they are manually adjusted. So, if you could go down into the panel room and fix the situation, I would highly appreciate your services.
[I think I can manage that.]
[General Arne] Fantastic! Head down, and I will be here to check as you go.

[General Arne] Ah, lovely! Everything is working smoothly now! This will be perfect for our tests!
[Why do you need to test a trebuchet?]
[General Arne] What a silly question, to make sure it works obviously! However, there is a second reason. You seem trustworthy enough, so I'll let you in on something. Recently, the government has developed a new weapon, similar to a trebuchet, but moveable on land, ice, sand, anything! It will be a fantastic asset in the war. We test this trebuchet for experimental data for this new weapon.
[Seems powerful.]
[General Arne] Quite! With this at our disposal, Alnera better watch their backs. Their era of slavery won't last much longer.
[Slavery?]
[General Arne] You've not heard of it? I guess you don't really seem like you're from around here, so let me explain. One of the reasons we conflict with Ishnir is the government's abuse towards their people.
[General Arne] The royals and bureaucrats of Alnera live in luxury, while their lower class, who have been shipped off to Molta, slave day after day in ceaseless mining operations. No rights, no pay. They are slaves to the system, and we strive for a world in which they are free.

[Ambassador Matori] You've got some guts to just walk into an Ambassador's house. My property is protected by law, you know.

[What are you an ambassador to?]
[Ambassador Matori] I am the Ambassador to the Chillwind.
[Aren't you in a war with the Chillwind?]
[Must be a hard job.]
[Ambassador Matori] Yes, thank you for reminding me that I'm apparently not very good at my job. 
[Ambassador Matori] You've got some guts to just walk into an Ambassador's house. My property is protected by law, you know.
[I'm sorry, I didn't realize.]
[What are you an ambassador to?]
[Ambassador Matori] I don't mean to be rude, but if I just let anyone walk in, my throat would have been slit years ago. Besides, I'm quite on edge right now, so startling me is not the best idea. I've got a lot on my plate.
[What has you on edge?]
[Ambassador Matori] Just... the war, I suppose. It makes my job as the Ambassador of Chillwind a... rough position, to say the least. All of my days are spent hearing constant yelling, and battle strategies, and equally horrid plans of action. I... guess I just long for days of peace.
[Is there anything I can do to help?]
[Ambassador Matori] Ha! Can you solve hundreds of years of political turmoil in a day? That'd be swell. That said, I would love a nice cup of tea. Not just any tea, Royal Red tea, some of the most delicious tea in all of Ishnir. An old hag in Rahkeri named Surya sells the leaves, and I would very much appreciate you bringing some here so I can brew some.
[I think I can handle that.]
[Ambassador Matori] Thank you so kindly!

The Foreign Soldier [2/2]: Head to Rahkeri and find the tea seller Surya.

-824, 1366[Ambassador Matori] Ah, fantastic! They smell wonderful! I'll get the pot going now. You don't know how much this helps me. My thoughts can finally clear up from...
[From?]
[Ambassador Matori] Well, I was just thinking about Wispervale, one of the more contentious points of our conflicts with the Chillwind. It comes up quite a bit in war strategy meetings. You see, one of the reasons we conflict so heavily with the Chillwind due to their obsessive hatred against the use of magic. They hunt down magic users like dogs, and have even subjected some to public executions.
[Ambassador Matori] The people of Ishnir simply wish for a world where magic can freely be used by everyone, and Wispervale is an outpost for such ideals, stationed right in the heart of the Chillwind. They are subjugated for their use of magic, but one day, they will be free.
[Why does-]
[Ambassador Matori] Ooo! Seems my tea is ready! Again, thank you so much!

[Kugo] Hmm... Aren't these fungal specimens great?
[Why are you keeping mushrooms in your house?]
[Kugo] Why, I study them, of course. Unfortunately, I can't keep all my specimens here- not enough space. I have to use a storage unit I own just down the way to house them all.
[What do you research them for?]
[Kugo] Haha! I couldn’t possibly say! Interests in taking over the world, maybe? Who knows!
[Not the answer I was expecting.]
[Kugo] Hah, I merely jest! I’m a scientist, I study things because they need to be studied. I merely wish I could increase my specimen samples a bit more, ah, the dreams!
[Increase how?]
[Kugo] You see, I have a large array of knowledge of fungal species from Ishnir, and even some from the Viridian region. However, the ones that elude me come from the Chillwind. I hear stories of a large fungal forest that exists there, crystalline mushrooms of enormous size! Ah, how I wish I could get a sample of it. Alas, I'm much too busy with my current studies to make time to travel there.
[I could probably get a sample for you.]
[Kugo] Really?! That would be fantastic! Thank you so much! I hear of such wonders in the Crystal Forest Grove, I can't wait to see what you return with!

The Foreign Soldier [2/2]: Head towards the Crystal Forest Grove for a fungal sample.

[Kugo] It's... it's beautiful! Look at the mycelium threads! Is this really a fungus? How fascinating, I can't... I can't...
Kugo begins to cry a little.
[What's the matter?]
[Kugo] I... I may have lied to you a little. I'm not just a researcher... Specifically, I am a researcher for the government. They... they took an interest in my knowledge of fungal species, and wanted me to determine a way to destroy the crystalline shroom forest in Chillwind...
[Why would they want that?]
RainieMan joined the game
[Kugo] I... I don't know. The war ravages all, I suppose. But... after seeing this specimen, I... I can't let that happen. A species such as this, where its very being is intertwined with crystalline essence, is incredibly rare. I refuse to let them destroy such a thing.
You likely won't get any more info out of Kugo. Your list has been updated.
You have talked to everyone on your list of influential people. You should return to Vargos with the information you have gathered.

[Vargos] Ah, Sukie, back so soon! How did things go? Did you manage to collect any information?
[Yes, but it's not simple to explain.]
[Vargos] Oh? Do tell.
[It seems the two nations don't really agree on why they are fighting.]
[Vargos] Hmm... conflicting reasons? How odd. I won't pretend I understand the political turmoil here, but there must be a common underlying reason that the conflicts restarted recently. If I had to make a guess...
[Izzy] I hate to interrupt here, but I've just gotten word that we have some visitors on the island.
[Visitors?]
SirTudor left the game
Killer0505 left the game
[Izzy] It seems our hunch was correct, the royals of the nations did have their eyes on you, and they've each sent an emissary to speak with the new captain of Mistport.
[What should we do?]
[Vargos] Well Sukie, I believe this is the chance we've been looking for. As bad as it sounds, we need to side with one of the nations, at least for now.
[Why would we do that?]
[Vargos] Think about it, our connections in the Isles are sparse, and we can only accomplish so much. If we allied ourselves with one of the nations, this would give us access to their vast information network. We'd be able to track Calder down much more efficiently.
[I guess you're right.]
[Vargos] I'll leave the decision of which nation we should ally with up to you, this is your island afterall. Choose wisely though, once you have made a decision, I doubt the other side will be very forgiving.
[Izzy] You'll find the emissaries near Xeno's old ship. They are stationed out on the docks there.
Make your decision carefully before speaking to the emissary of your choice, as it might affect future outcomes.

The Foreign Soldier: Head to the docks in front of Xeno's ship and decide which kingdom you will be siding with.

[Emissary of Ishnir] Ah, Captain Sukie! The kingdom of Ishnir wishes you a fair welcome. We have only just heard of your recent take down of Xeno. The Pharoah extends the most sincerest of thanks for removing him from power.

[Duchess Emmeline] Perhaps, but what are they going to do about it? Blackmail has a way of keeping people quiet for quite a while, and they are easy enough to dispose of if it stops being effective.
[Duchess Emmeline] The diplomats are already on their way, so I would advise getting ready to meet with them. You need to get your city in order, first impressions and all that. I expect results and can't guarantee your city will be happy should you fail.
[I assume that is a threat?]
[00:15:20] [main/WARN]: Unknown custom packed identifier: venturechat:data
[Duchess Emmeline] Not at all, it is more common sense. Many of your citizens are fans of mine. I can't guarantee that they wouldn't react violently, or try to assassinate someone you care about. Trust me, if I was threatening you, it would be far more obvious. I want to build a good working relationship with you, and that requires you not being randomly murdered.
[Duchess Emmeline] Salieri, please see our guest out when they are ready to depart.

[Salieri] I will try to keep this short. You are too charismatic to be a spy on your own. So I was told to give you a communication device. With it, you will be able to both detect and listen into conversations. My employer would rather you keep our involvement a secret. Is that understood?
[I understand.]
[What if I lose the communication device?]
[Why is it a communication device if it lets me spy on people?]

An Unlikely Partnership: Speak to Indigo about the current situation with the diplomats.

[Captain Indigo] Hello there Captain Sukie. Feels odd calling you that.
[Can we sail back to the King's Valley?]
[We have a situation.]
[Captain Indigo] A situation? What is it this time?
[Diplomats from the two kingdoms are on their way.]
[We ran out of rum.]
[Captain Indigo] Why would they come here on such short notice, or here at all? Security is going to be needed to keep them safe, and we have no food, decorations, or housing ready. Can we tell them to wait?
[The Duchess invited them on our behalf.]
[We can’t, but you're safer not knowing why.]
[00:22:01] [main/WARN]: Unknown custom packed identifier: venturechat:data
[Captain Indigo] Alright, I'll take care of it. Just speak to me when you're ready to proceed.

An Unlikely Partnership [1/2]: Tell Indigo that you are ready to proceed.
An Unlikely Partnership [2/2]: Once the diplomats arrive speak to either one of them.

[Captain Indigo] Are you ready to go greet our guests?
[I am ready.]
[No, I still need to get ready.]
[Can we sail back to the King's Valley?]
[Captain Indigo] We barely had enough time to make things presentable. Hopefully it is good enough. The diplomats should be here shortly.
[00:22:47] [main/WARN]: Unknown custom packed identifier: venturechat:data
[Captain Indigo] Sounds like they’re here, it’s showtime, Captain Sukie.

[Captain Indigo] There they are. Their bodyguards are rather intimidating, but they seem nice enough. Hopefully we managed to get enough prepared to avoid offending them.

[Chillwind Bodyguard] ...
[Ishnir Bodyguard] ...
[Wilhelm] Reports... Reports... Ugh, I still need to deal with the paperwork from the latest incident...
He seems a bit preoccupied at the moment.
[Wilhelm, Chillwind Diplomat] Greetings, Captain Sukie. The Queen sends her regards.
[Torren, Ishnir Diplomat] As does the Pharaoh. I must say, Captain Sukie, you’ve already exceeded our expectations, the best Xeno ever did was send us invitations to “walk the plank”.
[Wilhelm, Chillwind Diplomat] Speaking of walking the plank… Thank you, Torren, for moving your ship out to sea so we could dock. I don’t know why we needed such a large vessel.
<G> [FISH] __Veron » how much does heart of greed cost?
[Torren, Ishnir Diplomat] Likely an attempt at showing your country’s power, as if either of us care about such things.

<G> [LAG] EmilyVEVO » NOPE
[Captain Indigo] Those two looked oddly comfortable with each other, considering their countries are on the brink of war. I'll go with them so they don't get lost.

An Unlikely Partnership [1/2]: Talk to Indigo and find out where some of your guests went.
An Unlikely Partnership [2/2]: Should you leave the party for any reason, you can talk to Indigo to get back in.

[Vargos] Ah, good to finally get some fresh air. Oh, Captain Sukie, have you been there long?
[How're you, Vargos?]
[Thanks for the help with the preparations.]
<G> [FORCE] emeraldcore71 » ah
[Vargos] It was my pleasure. You have done much for the Valley, it was good to have a way to repay my debts.
[Vargos] Ah, good to finally get some fresh air. Oh, Captain Sukie, have you been there long?
[How're you, Vargos?]
[Thanks for the help with the preparations.]
[Vargos] I’m fine, if a bit exhausted. Teleporting people in for the past three hours took quite a bit out of me.

[Swordsman Myrl] So far so good Captain. Everyone has been on their best behavior.
[I assume they were told how important this was for the city?]
[Swordsman Myrl] They were. However, more importantly, they were reminded that we have plenty of room in the prison, if they act up.
[Captain Indigo] Oh hey Sukie. I'm exhausted. Do you know how hard it is to get this many pirates organized?
[Have you seen where any of our guests went?]

[Claudia] Of course they are! See, we drew one right on the first page! They are eating a salad.
[Claude] It 'as been ages since I last cooked alongside my sister. We have prepared them a dish to die for. it will be marvelous!

[Vargos] Ah, good to finally get some fresh air. Oh, Captain Sukie, have you been there long?
[Did you happen to see any Chillwind Crew come through here?]
[How're you, Vargos?]
[Thanks for the help with the preparations.]
frogyfro has defeated Vernal Nightmare!
LordGeek101 has defeated Vernal Nightmare!
[Vargos] Yes, one of the crew members seemingly had gotten landsick. They took him aboard the ship for him to recover.

[Chillwind Quartermaster] What brings you here, Captain Sukie?
[Are they going to be okay? They don't look well.]
[Do you need anything?]
[What are your thoughts on the current conflict?]
[Chillwind Quartermaster] Very kind of you to show so much concern. They have a rather bad case of landsickness. Being on a ship for too long can cause some interesting problems.
[Chillwind Quartermaster] What brings you here, Captain Sukie?
[Are they going to be okay? They don't look well.]
[Do you need anything?]
[What are your thoughts on the current conflict?]
[Chillwind Quartermaster] We should be fine, thankfully bouts of landsickness tend to last about as long as bouts of seasickness do.
[Chillwind Quartermaster] What brings you here, Captain Sukie?
[Are they going to be okay? They don't look well.]
[Do you need anything?]
[What are your thoughts on the current conflict?]
[Chillwind Quartermaster] Ishnir has gone too far this time. If those filthy magic users were willing to do what they did, where they did, there is no telling what they would do to us, if given a chance. Unfortunately, I think the time for peace is over, and Mistport's involvement might prove key in the coming days.
<G> fairbot » to upgrade the tlaxan mask do i just put it and caxtals mask in the crafter or am i missing something?
[Landsick Chillwind Sailor] Urg... Hello Captain. What brings you here?
[Are you okay? You seem rather unwell.]
[Do you need anything?]
[What are your thoughts on the current conflict?]
[Landsick Chillwind Sailor] You didn't have to *URF* check on me Captain. I'm just feeling rather landsick, I haven't been off a boat in years. Why does the ground have to not sway back and forth so much.
[Landsick Chillwind Sailor] Urg... Hello Captain. What brings you here?
[Are you okay? You seem rather unwell.]
[Do you need anything?]
[What are your thoughts on the current conflict?]
[Landsick Chillwind Sailor] I will be fine Captain. I just need some rest, and for the floor to start moving again.
[Landsick Chillwind Sailor] Urg... Hello Captain. What brings you here?
[Are you okay? You seem rather unwell.]
[Do you need anything?]

[Landsick Chillwind Sailor] *HURF* The diplomat saw me and some glowy thing came out of his hands and I started feeling a bit better. It was magic I tell you. Our own diplomat was using magic!
[Chillwind Quartermaster] You must be seeing things. I was there with you and I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Perhaps your landsickness made you imagine it?
[Landsick Chillwind Sailor] You are probably *URGH* right. I'll probably forget all about it when I'm feeling better. He isn't that type of person.

[Yeah, while unlikely, have you seen a third group pass through here?]
[I am sorry for putting this all on you.]
[Have you seen Tiffy?]
[I need to get out of here, for a while.]
[Captain Indigo] Well, the Ishnir Adviser has been upstairs, though good luck getting up there without making a ruckus. Levyn was suppose to be pruning the vines outside, he might be able to help you.
<G> fairbot » bone shards?
An Unlikely Partnership [1/2]: Speak to Levyn about how to get upstairs. Also make sure he is okay.
Levyn looks heavily dazed and battered.
[Levyn] Uuuughghhhhh…..
[Are you ok?]
[Should I go get a doctor?]
[Levyn] Yaarrrrrr…. I’ll be fine, just fell off the building and hit me head.
[Well, do you happen to know a way to climb onto the balcony upstairs?]
[Levyn] Aye, I didn’t trim back the vines before the party started, as you can see. You could use them to climb up. I think I'm going to rest here a bit longer.

[Torren, Ishnir Diplomat] I did not expect to have to meet again under these circumstances, Captain Sukie, but your obvious and overt spying sort of forced our hand.
<G> fairbot » ah ok
[Wilhelm, Chillwind Diplomat] However, I dare say this was expected. I could see the distress in your eyes, and the entire affair reeks of Emmeline's handiwork. Although, the party was pretty well executed for the time you likely had. I don't want you breaking things within my mind, so I would like to ask you to stay still.
[Wait, you know the Duchess?]
<L> [LAG] EmilyVEVO » the more i stay here
<L> [LAG] EmilyVEVO » the more my screen shakes

[Wilhelm, Chillwind Diplomat] She can't hear anything we say as long as we are talking to each other like this, however I can't maintain this link for much longer. Captain Sukie, I have a request...
[Torren, Ishnir Diplomat] No, WE have a request. We cannot ask blood to be spilt, but for the good of the isles, we ask that, by some means, Emmeline is dealt with. She jeopardizes the stability of the region with every breath she takes. One way or another, she needs to be stopped.
[Why me?]
[Wilhelm, Chillwind Diplomat] You are the Captain of Mistport. You are one of the easiest ways for her to spread her influence around.
[Torren, Ishnir Diplomat] If we act like this talk never happened, she will surely contact you again. Eventually, she may even drop her guard... Wilhelm's focus is waning fast, thankfully it lasted long enough.
[Wilhelm, Chillwind Diplomat] Yes, soon this link will break, and the party will come to an end. Once it does, we shall return to our own countries. To sate a portion of your probable curiosity, Captain Sukie, we've been friends since childhood. The Isles can facilitate friendships even across the vastness of the ocean.

An Unlikely Partnership: Speak to Tiffy about what has happened.

[Captain Indigo] That went much better than I was expecting; did you get what you were looking for out of the party, Captain Sukie?
[Yeah, thanks for the help.]
[Sort of, thanks for the help though.]
[Not even close, did have a bunch of fun though!]
[Can we sail back to the King's Valley?]
[Captain Indigo] No problem, I'm just glad those diplomats seemed to enjoy their time here. Last thing we need is more enemies. Oh, by the way, Tiffy was looking for you.

[Tiffy] Ello, ol’ chap, how did the mission go?
[She should have the information she requested. Here's the communicator back.]
<L> [LAG] EmilyVEVO » wait let me get near

[Tiffy] Ello, ol’ chap, how did the mission go?

[Tiffy] Jolly good show that is. Don't worry about the communicator, I happened to find it for you.
[You can cut out the accent, you have a lot to answer for.]
<L> [PP] Wembler » nevermind
[Tiffy] Indeed I do ol' chap, but so do you at this point. Neither of us chose to become employed by her. Also, I don't know what accent you mean. Anyway, here is your reward, a Spymaster 9001.
[What? That's it?]
<L> [PP] Wembler » uh might need to restart the shard
[Tiffy] What were you expecting? The Duchess doesn't pay easily, and that orb is worth more than all of your possessions put together. Besides, the advice from the guy on the other side is PRICELESS... Eh, take this too, it's not like I need it anymore.

[Dr. Qure] Hmm... Now where did I put that...?
[Hello?]
He's deep in thought while trying to find something in his office.
[Dr. Qure] Oh! I'm terribly sorry, I didn't notice you come in. What can I do for you?
[I was wondering more what I could do for you.]
[How about some medical jokes?]
[Dr. Qure] Oh, really now? Well I suppose there is this one thing...
[Dr. Qure] You see, I've lost the ingredients to make a special vitality remedy commonly used in these parts, quite a marvelous elixir! If you could fetch me some of those I could apply it to you for your travels too!
[I'm in. Where should I start?]
[I'll pass for now. They might still be in your office anyway!]
[Dr. Qure] Well, first of all, I require a Tenebre Mushroom from some fungal caves in the nearby islands.

QUEST : Vital Needs
Length : Short
Difficulty : Easy-Medium
Search for different ingredients for the Doctor's remedy

Vital Needs [1/2]: Travel to the Fungus Thorn Cave in order to obtain a Tenebre Mushroom.

[Dr. Qure] Ah perfect! You found one! 
The Doctor chucks some of the mushroom into a mortar and begins to grind it into a fine paste.
[Alright then, what's next?]
[Dr. Qure] Hmm, a fresh Saragundi Sapling from a nearby forest. I'd say the Feyrune Forest would have an ample supply.

Vital Needs [1/2]: Travel to Feyrune Forest in order to get a Saragundi Sapling.
Vital Needs [2/2]: Once you have a Saragundi Sapling, return to Dr. Qure.

#Q120I02 https://puu.sh/GNB1s/242effd8b8.png

[Dr. Qure] Fantastic, it looks to be in perfect health!
The Doctor throws some leaves of the sapling into the mortar.
[What's the final ingredient?]
[Dr. Qure] So, finally, I require a bottle of Kelp Oil. Unfortunately, some pirates had stolen the last bottle I had from me... I believe they've gone back to their base camp in the Spiral Island.
[Lovely...]
Zerur left the game
[Dr. Qure] Yes, well I suppose it shouldn't be too much harder than fetching the other supplies.

Vital Needs [1/2]: Travel to Spiral Island to retrieve some Kelp Oil.
Vital Needs [2/2]: Once you have some Kelp Oil, return to Dr. Qure.

#Q120I03 https://puu.sh/GNB27/670cb794d3.png

[Dr. Qure] Great work! That's the final ingredient!
He pours a drop of the oil into the mortar, and then puts the mixture into a vial.
[So, does the medicine work?]
[Dr. Qure] Of course it does! Applying it should give the person great vitality for a good while! With this fresh supply, I should have enough for weeks! Take this for your troubles.
VITAL NEEDS COMPLETE!
Awarded 28 Crystalline Shards and access to Dr. Qure's healing remedy!

[How does this concern me though?]
[Historian Rhodes] Well you see, while I've been able to uncover quite a fair amount of information from the city, it seems all account of Salazar's whereabouts post-fall of Viridia... simply don't exist, at least that we have found.

<G> [MB] pogocto » poh
[Historian Rhodes] As hungry as we are for knowledge, there is still much here that needs reviewing, possibly even things waiting to be discovered. The undercity is vast and filled with extraordinary amounts of information. My ask of you is to look around and help us search out information on Salazar. If information does exist, it has to be here. If you manage to find anything, let me know.

[Historian Sen] You know, I love reading about history and all... But actually seeing history like this? This makes it all the more worth while.
[Historian Kauli] It's such a shame that a city with this much knowledge was buried for so long. The amount of history that could have been lost forever is insane.
[Historian Rizza] There's a book here called "Thicker Than Blood". It seems to be much newer than all the rest, doesn't have nearly as much decay. I wonder how that occurred.
[Historian Jaik] It seems the mechanism that once existed here finally hit its limit. Consider yourself lucky to be the last person in history to use it.
[Historian Vas] I doubt I'll ever get these books to stop smelling like the ocean.
[Historian Caer] It seems the original purpose of these large pillars was to act as magical conduits to power the rest of the city. I wonder if we can learn anything from them.
[Historian Lax] Some of these books are just so cryptic in their phrasing. This was supposed to be a city founded on knowledge, how were they suppose to pass off knowledge if no one could understand what they were saying?

FireOverheat has defeated the Alchemy Labs!
[Harmonious Spirit] Originally it was a way for my ancestors to identify individuals trustworthy enough to be near the pink wool. Unfortunately, once that monster took over the process was used against us. We didn't stand a chance. We were sacrificed to that thing to help it come into our world faster.

[Harmonious Spirit] Yes, I do know of Brother Salazar. Though it is not a story I recount with uplifting emotions. However, you have helped me more than I can repay, and I told you I would pass off the knowledge of which I was capable.
[Can you tell me what happened to him after the fall of Viridia?]
Welcome Shallowbage27 to the server!
[Harmonious Spirit] In a sense, yes. In a sense, no. I can merely guide you to where the information you seek lies. But first, you will need something.
[Harmonious Spirit] In the rising tunnels above us - that which your people call the Sealed Descent - there lies a blessed shard of glass. Seek it out and return it here.

Rapacity: Journey back through the Sealed Descent to find the blessed glass for the Harmonious Spirit.

Rapacity: Find your way into the Father's study. You can speak to the Harmonious Spirit for directions.

Magic Mirror #Q110I05

[Harmonious Spirit] Welcome to the Father's hall. You likely did not see this portion of the Arboretum on your last trek through here, though some other areas are modeled after it.
[What's going on here?]
[How do I unlock the study door in the corrupted world?]
[I wish to leave.]
<G> dhaboi » hello?
<G> snowflakezs » hi
[Harmonious Spirit] Perhaps I should explain to you more concisely what I meant by "in a sense". You see, the information you seek does not exist. At least, not in this realm. The Father kept a journal, locked away within his study, but it has long since been lost.
[Harmonious Spirit] However, if it does not exist within this world, that implies that it does exist within the corrupted world, as all things there occur in opposite. If you can unlock the study in the corrupted world and remove the book from there, you might be able to bring the book into existence within our world.
[How do I unlock the study door in the corrupted world?]

[Harmonious Spirit] The study door can be opened if you understand the following conditions:
- The study door will unlock when all other doors in the corrupted world are in their open position at once.
- I have given you the tool I crafted for you, a Magic Mirror that allows you to traverse back from the corrupted world at will. To get to the corrupted world, however, you must use the rift located downstairs.
- Remember that all actions taken within the corrupted world have the opposite effect in this world.
- Father was quite brilliant, and traps have likely been laid. If you find yourself stuck and unable to leave a room, you will find the Magic Mirror's second function to be useful, and will return the Hall to the way you currently see it.

As the final door in the corrupted world unlocks, the sounds of mechanisms fill the halls. The corrupted world's log room has been opened.

The corrupted log crumbles upon holding it. The log room in the normal world has likely been filled as a result.

Excommunication #Q110I07

[Harmonious Spirit] It seems you have managed to collect the log. Let us leave this place, I wish not to linger here for longer than we must. We will speak once we have exited the Arboretum.

Rapacity: Speak to the Harmonious Spirit

[Harmonious Spirit] Thank you for everything. I'm sure you have many questions about what you saw inside, and about my people.
[What was that thing inside there?]
[What granted your people the various gifts?]
[Why were people selected to come here?]
[Why did the gifts stop?]
[What next?]
[Talk about Rapacity]
[Harmonious Spirit] I assume you have had time to ponder on the Father's log.
[Salazar... was he the one to break the Pink wool?]
<G> MrBSPetaByte » what to expect in part 2 of lime?
<G> [FORCE] emeraldcore71 » ./l <message>
[Harmonious Spirit] You now understand the truth, and why his name brings me great pain. His actions directly led to the events that soon followed - the death of my people at the hands of a demon who tore into our world through the rift Brother Salazar caused.
[The book mentions someone named Varcosa.]
<G> Spaghetti_Sock » ty
<G> [FORCE] emeraldcore71 » flying creepers
[Harmonious Spirit] I was unaware of this fate, or I would have told you before. In my time, Varcosa was an infamous pirate, known for causing mass havoc even to the nations. He was known for showing no mercy, and that makes me doubtful that Brother Salazar survived much longer beyond that point.
[Is there anywhere I can get information on Varcosa?]
<G> [FORCE] emeraldcore71 » glowing invis endermen
<G> Fishywishi » lol
<G> MrBSPetaByte » Charged?
<G> [FORCE] emeraldcore71 » no
<G> [FORCE] emeraldcore71 » they ride phantoms tho, not bad at all
[Harmonious Spirit] It is fairly likely that some historical records exist. If what I remember is correct, Varcosa was originally a citizen of Ishnir. If any documents remains, an archivist familiar with that nation's history will be your best bet. Alnera may be a good place to start looking.

Rapacity: Head to Alnera and seek out information once again from Archivist Nyra.

[Archivist Nyra] Hello there. What brings you to the pharaoh's library today?
[Who are you?]
[The pharaoh's library is open to the public?]
[What can you tell me about Alnera?]
[Do you have any records on a pirate named Varcosa?]
<G> [Rend] Pacific_Legend » Oh no! The president
[Archivist Nyra] Oh so you've stopped searching after fictional things like the Gem of Ishnir? Yes, of course we have records on the legendary pirate. Let's see, Varcosa was originally born in Ishnir, though gave up his birthright to pursue pirating roughly around 225 CCE.
[Archivist Nyra] Twenty five years later, in 250 CCE, Varcosa declared himself the king of the seas, and headed out for his final voyage. No records exist of him beyond that date, it is presumed he died at sea.
[His final voyage?]

[Any idea where he went?]
[18:59:23] [main/WARN]: Unknown custom packed identifier: venturechat:data
[Archivist Nyra] Yes and no. There is an old map that was found a few decades back, though it has suffered heavy damage over the centuries. It is currently on loan to the records holder in Molta for inspection. Shani, I believe is her name.

Rapacity: It seems Shani in Molta currently has Varcosa's map. Seek her out.

[Record Keeper Shani] Hello! Welcome to the Molta Arch- AH! Sukie! It's nice to see you again! I wish the last time we met were under better circumstances, though I hear you used the information I gave you to cause quite a stir with Boris.

[What did you want it for?]
[Record Keeper Shani] You see, I found a record a few weeks back that may have hinted at the final voyage of the infamous ruler of the waves. There was a mention of  "Corsair's Claw".

<G> [Rend] Moniker1 » I managed not to die using Thaumaturge's
[Record Keeper Shani] That's not entirely surprising, it doesn't exist. Or at least, I didn't believe so until I found this record. Corsair's Claw is a mythical island shrouded in legend, mostly used as a bedtime story to scare children. 
[Record Keeper Shani] I hoped that, if I could possibly make something out of the map, it would lead me in the right direction - possibly even to the mythical island itself. Sadly, it is so worn down, its impossible to read it.
[Is there nothing that can be done?]
<G> [FORCE] emeraldcore71 » lol
<G> [Rend] Moniker1 » I'll use a better armor kit next time
[Record Keeper Shani] I wouldn't quite say nothing. In older times like this, pirates didn't have access to quills to write with, and thus they had to resort to using ship scraps in order to draw maps. Because of this, they needed special ink that would stick well. This sort of became tradition among pirates who sail the northern seas, even today, to continue to use this special ink. 
[Record Keeper Shani] If you can manage to track some down and get some of it, I might be able to make an etching of the map. Be warned though, Northern pirates are much different from the ones you may be familiar with, Ocean's Reach is not kind, so they have to fight to survive. I have heard word that a certain crew is fighting off a sea monster attack. This may be the only chance we can get, while they are distracted.

Rapacity: You need some special mapping ink carried by Northern pirates. Search out a crew that is currently fighting off a sea monster attack and grab it while they are distracted.

Thick Ink Puch (#Q110I01)

[Record Keeper Shani] Ah, good good! You actually managed to get some! Alright, give me just a minute to get the etching done... careful now... apply slightly... Alright! I think that may actually have done the trick! It's rough, but I think it may be good enough. Here, have a look at it.

Rapacity: You've made a copy of Varcosa's map! Follow it to its destination! You can get information on the map, or retrieve another one, by speaking to Shani.

[Record Keeper Shani] It's quite interesting... I can just about make out that landmass at the top to be the southern tip of Ishnir, which would imply that this is pointing somewhere in the southeastern sea. If you are also interested in Varcosa, I ask that you follow this map. I am unfortunately stuck here, but I ask you come back and tell me of your trip if you find anything.
[I lost the map you gave me.]
[Record Keeper Shani] That's pretty careless of you. Thankfully I have just enough ink left for another etching.

You start to feel a bit odd as you continue further through the tunnel.

[Historian Rhodes] Isn't the undercity amazing? It's hard for me to remove my eyes from it. Anyway, have you had any luck searching for clues about Salazar around here?

[Historian Rhodes] Exactly what I asked you to come here for. I need your assistance in finding any information we can on Salazar.
[But... We already found his book here.]
[Historian Rhodes] I have no idea what you're talking about Sukie. You're beginning to **confuse** me.

[Historian Sen] You know, I love reading about history and all... But actually seeing history like this? This makes it all the more worth while.
[I don't understand what's happening.]
[Historian Sen] Didn't you hear me? Enjoy this view. This is pure history in front of us. 
[I've already been here! Tell me what's going on!]

[Historian Sen] Oh come now Sukie. Theres no need to get **angry**.

[Historian Sen] There's no need for **anger** in a place like this Sukie. Enjoy the history around you.

[Harmonious Spirit] We meet again Sukie, how are you faring on your journey?
[How am I here now? And what happened to this lobby?]
[Harmonious Spirit] You seem upset Sukie, **fear** runs across your face. Try to rest here, your constant journies will unbalance your spirit.

[Echoing Thoughts] The will on this one is interesting. That pirate might finally have found his replacement. I will let my grip go. For now.

[Fading Spirit] Hmm... a new face? It's been... quite a while since I have seen one. How long now... decades? Centuries? I stopped counting a long time ago.
[Who are you?]
[Fading Spirit] In life, I was... a ruler... one who fell from grace... My kingdom long since turned to folly...
[Wait... Are you Salazar?]
[Fading Spirit] Mmm... It warms my spirit slightly to know that my name is still known... But... not quite enough to escape... not quite yet...

===Unmasked===

[Vargos] It feels almost like dumb luck that we've routed Calder's Masked. You should be very proud of your work. We have more work left though... it will never end until we take down the man himself.
[What can I do to help?]
[Vargos] As you know, we've taken the former Holy Advisor, Ridnan, into custody. We've been trying to crack him and gather information. Would you care to join us?
[I've been looking forward to this.]
[Later, when I have the time.]
[Vargos] Then let us travel there post haste.

QUEST : UNMASKED
Length : Very Long
Difficulty : Very Hard
Join Vargos and your crew in their questioning of the Masked, Ridnan.

Unmasked [1/2]: Talk to Vargos in the Jail.
Unmasked [2/2]: If you're not in the Jail, speak to Vargos to return to it.

[Brandy] Hello there Sukie. I’ve heard great things about you from Vargos and my daughter.
[Nice to meet you Brandy. What have you gotten out of Ridnan so far?]
[Your daughter?]
[Brandy] Oh of course. Cinevra is my daughter. She's quite the powerful little arcmage!
[Well, it's nice to meet you Brandy. What have you gotten out of Ridnan so far?]
[Brandy] Not much, he’s been spouting out fanatical nonsense, but nothing that will help us find Calder. 
[Can I try talking to him?]
[Brandy] Sure. I’ll be monitoring him, so no need to be afraid.
[Aimos] Ahoy Cap'n Sukie.
[Ahoy. Who are you?]
[Aimos] I'm Aimos. Yer mates pawned me off fer guard duty of this scum 'ere. If ye wanna know what he did, I wrote ya a log in ta chest over there.

[Aimos] Jus' cuz I'm a pirate don't mean I ain't literate, mate.
[Levyn] Ahoy Sukie! We get ta pick the brains o' some scum today, aye?
[Yes indeed.]
[Levyn] Let me at 'im! I'll learn all there be ta know!
[Ridnan] Sukie... Have you come to gloat at your victory? Even if you get rid of me, there are many who share my sentiment. You mages are a scourge upon the earth.
[Do you hate mages that much?]
<G> [LAG] VastPoenBV » Sigil in third chest moment :uwu:
[Ridnan] Of course I do! They should never have existed at all! I was so close... I should have realized that working for a filthy mage like Calder would cause trouble.
[Why did Calder want you to work for him in the first place?]
[Ridnan] Hah... He never told me what exactly, but he said he was searching for the resting place of ancient power.
[Did you find it?]
[Ridnan] We didn't, but we found an old scripture that hinted to its location.
[Is this scripture in Calder's hands?]
[Ridnan] ...
[Is it?]
[Ridnan] ...
[Brandy] Seems like he's decided not to talk anymore. Let me handle this.
<G> [DNG] rayman520 » still not gonna beat the 2 rares in first white chest i got
[Vargos] Go ahead, talk to Ridnan.
A loud cracking noise reverberates around the room.
[Ridnan] GAHH!
[Brandy] Does Calder have the scriptures?
[Ridnan] ...
[Brandy] Why do you continue to stay silent? Do you believe someone will come for you?
[Ridnan] ...
[Brandy] Your country has forsaken you. Your followers have been detained. And your master? Calder? I’ve known him far longer than you’ve been alive, boy. He won’t come for you. You’ve served your purpose.
[Ridnan] ...
<G> [LAG] VastPoenBV » I got 2 mats and 1 sigil in the first three chests :shrug:

[Vargos] After him!
[Izzy] Oh no... did we never seal the hole into the sewer?
[What hole?]
[Izzy] The one you escaped into, back when we made it to Mistport! Ridnan must have fled down it!
[I'll go after him.]
<G> [LAG] VastPoenBV » Eh
[Vargos] Be careful, I sense some seriously powerful magic afoot. Someone is down there with him. I fear the Masked aren’t done with us yet.

[Samwell] Of course I did, after all we saw. I’m throwing my hat in the ring with the winner. Lord Calder has power beyond your imagination. He is so close to having even more. The scriptures will be the way. I’m sure Ridnan, the little traitor, has already spilled the beans.

[Bhairavi] It has indeed! Now, the research I've done in the Valley made me believe that the last wool in the Isles was the Purple Wool. Now I'm beginning to think that the Blue Wool is in play here as well.
[The Blue Wool? How do you know?]
[Bhairavi] Has nobody told you about the Council's experience with the Wools? It's quite a long story, but I can summarize if you'd like.
[Please do (Short option).]
[I'm happy to listen (Long option).]
[Bhairavi] After many adventures and discoveries, the Mage Council discovered how to enter the Monument in the King’s Valley. It was there we were greeted by a vision… or a memory? Something. In it, we were shown sixteen wool of power. The ones you know, white, orange, magenta, and so on.
[What’s left to find then?]
[Bhairavi] Next would be Blue, Brown, Green, and Red. We began to investigate back then, and determined that White through Yellow were in the Valley, and that they seemed to be in groups. We were fairly sure that Lime through Purple would be together, then Blue through Black would be grouped. We began to investigate a lead into what we thought would be a higher wool, far from the Valley.
[But Calder got it first?]
[Bhairavi] Exactly. He had been off searching with his partner, on Council orders. We have no idea how he found the wool, but on his return, he revealed it, and slaughtered the Council. His partner hasn't been seen since. She's likely dead as well, damn him.
[That's horrible.]
[Bhairavi] Isn't it? Calder really seems to have a gift for this sort of miracle though, finding Wool where they don't belong. If this is even the Blue Wool at all...
[So what do we know? Is there anywhere I can go to find him?]
[Bhairavi] I think so. I’ve had some notes on a wool with time powers for a few months now. I keep finding references to the "Silver Knights", all over the Isles. If that name sounds familiar, it's because we also found an ancient Hammer with ties to them in Highwatch.
[Fascinating. But what about them and this wool?]
[Bhairavi] Well, the researchers here in Steelmeld have found artifacts relating to them in this place. Additionally, I found the crumbling ruins of what seems to be a Silver Knight statue in Ishnir. Inside a hidden compartment, I found what seems to be a scripture. I've partially deciphered it, and it mentions an artifact of Time hidden to the "West of the Monument". If you can finish it, maybe it could tell us more...
[I'm on it.]
[Bhairavi] Fantastic. Here's a copy, then! Once you work out where it's sending you, I'll send an assistant to join you there. Just head there and maybe you can work out what Calder is doing with this wool... Gods, I hope you're fast enough.

Unmasked: Translate the notes to find out where to go next. Speak to Bhairavi if you need a replacement book.

[Bhairavi] Once you've worked out what this says, I'll send an assistant to meet you at that spot! Just head there and maybe you can work out what Calder is doing with this wool... Gods, I hope you're fast enough.
[Can I have another copy of the book?]
[Bhairavi] Of course. I'm used to you losing my research by now.

Ancient Writings #Q124I01
soon all will feel the grim touch of time
so forth went the knights
where time was long lost
sacrarium found

Reality warps before you, time gets reversed and you find yourself moving backwards, stopping at the top of the staircase.

[???] Hey, are you Sukie? You showed up at the perfect time, some masked guy attacked me as I got here but it seems your arrival scared him off.
[Who are you?]
[Max] I'm Max, I know Bhairavi. I have a fair idea on the current situation you're in, but I'd appreciate it if you filled me in.
[Sure.]
You recount the past events and actions leading up to now.
[Max] ...I see. That's pretty rough. I've heard of this Calder guy but I didn't expect that I might be confronting him directly.
[He's dangerous, but we need to stop him.]
[Max] Thankfully, I'm not a wimp. Anyway, have you seen this gateway? This magical barrier is inlaid in the stone here, you can see the small scriptures on the border of the stonework.
[I never noticed that.]
[Max] It▒s not something a lot of people notice, don▒t worry. I do a lot of rune work so I tend to notice those things. Anyways! I▒ve been sitting here reading it and I think I deciphered most of it.
[You can read this?]
[Max] Of course. It▒s quite ancient, but I▒m very good with old languages. This seems to predate the Ishnir and Chillwind societies, but I▒ve not the foggiest what those people called themselves. They seem to mention this being a way to house their home, and a... Teal Wool? Can you step back for a bit?
Max mutters a few words under his breath, and you hear a shattering noise as the nearby crystal breaks. The runes glow a faint blue hue as the barrier around the stairs fade.
[Max] Excellent. The spell I crafted seemed to work. I▒ll see you inside?
[Inside where?]
[Max] Whatever these ancient folks didn▒t want us to see of course. I hope it▒s as big as you say. Take this, by the way. You'll need it. See you down there!


Unmasked [1/2]: Follow Max down the stairs...
Unmasked [2/2]: ...and enter the Echoes of Oblivion.

Reality warps before you, time speeds up and you find youself moving faster than expected, stopping in a room somewhere below the Sacrarium.

> Unmasked: Return to Bhairavi, defeated.

[Bhairavi] Welcome back Sukie. I'm so happy to see you alive still. What happened? Did you see Calder? Did you get the wool? Was Barte any help?
[I don't think things could have gone worse.]
[Bhairavi] Um...
[I never met a Barte. I met a Max.]
[Bhairavi] Oh... no...
[We explored what was hidden below the Sacrarium of Aeons. A whole kingdom, warped through time.]
[Bhairavi] And the blue wool?
[The TEAL wool. Destroyed. By Maxwell Calder.]
[Bhairavi] But... how?
[The Black Wool. It gets worse though.]
[Bhairavi] What could be worse than the loss of a wool?
[The wool had something inside. A being. It destroyed the place around us.]
[Bhairavi] Why did Calder destroy the wool at all?
[He claims this has always been his goal.]
[Bhairavi] Insanity...
[What do we do, Bhairavi?]
[Bhairavi] I have no idea, Sukie. I'm sorry. I'll need to meet with the rest of the Council. We have far too much to discuss. Nothing we thought we knew seems to be true. New wool, destroyed? Calder's goals? This is disastrous... We need to locate the being that was inside that wool. We'll talk soon, okay? For now, take these, please.

==Here There Be Dragons==

[Izzy] Ahh Sukie, what impeccable timing you always have.
[That sounds like you’re signing me up to do something.]
[Izzy] I absolutely am, and it’s a big one! I've heard about your adventure in the ruins of the Congress. A brand new wool? The Teal Spirit involved again? Turns out the Mage Council isn't done yet, and has tasked me to investigate another source of Teal-adjacent magic somewhere in the northwest ocean. I wanted to ask you to come along. Maybe we can finish this.
[Well that does sound worthy of my time.]
[Oh no, not another sea voyage...]
[Izzy] Worry not, this won’t be some scrappy pirate operation. We’ve been funded by the Council to outfit the ship with high-end magical equipment and actually edible food. It’ll practically be a vacation. I’ll do all the work and all I need you for is in case of emergency!
[A vacation would be kind of nice. Count me in.]
[Izzy] Wonderful. I’d be remiss not to employ Indigo for this expedition, so go let her know the good news and meet me in the Mistport Pub basement. We’ve got to carry the supplies I purchased over to her ship.

QUEST : HERE THERE BE DRAGONS
Length : Medium
Difficulty : Hard
Accompany Izzy on a voyage to investigate traces of the Teal Spirit.

Here There Be Dragons: Talk to Captain Indigo.

[Captain Indigo] Ahoy Sukie, to what do I owe the pleasure today?
[Izzy has lined up an expedition and wants to employ you and your ship to do some magical research.]
[Captain Indigo] Well that is good news! I could really use the income. Ever since I transported Bhairavi and her team here the work has been pretty sparse. When do we set sail?
[Izzy needed my help grabbing supplies out of the Pub basement. We set sail when we return.]
[Captain Indigo] I’ll ready the ship then. See you in a jiffy.

Here There Be Dragons: Meet Izzy in the Salty Seaswindler basement.

[Izzy] Took you long enough. I was starting to get unwelcome looks from the pirates upstairs. It’s like they can sense I’ve got a mountain of money to fund this expedition.
Izzy gathers up a few bags of supplies and...
[Levyn] Argh do me ears deceive me? Or did I hear that me crew be planning a voyage without me!
[Levyn, what are you doing down here?]
[Levyn] I’ve fallen on hard times, ye see. The bartender bet I couldn’t finish off a keg of ale...
He burps loudly...
[Levyn] ...but I showed ‘im. As payment fer the bet I acquired free room an’ board down ‘ere in the bilge of this ‘ere establishment.
[Do you need help?]
[Levyn] Me? Need help?? Ye be askin’ that the wrong way around. Levyn’s crew is nothin’ without Levyn! And I know just the way to spend that cash ye have to make this trip run ship shape.
[I think Izzy already covered supplies.]
[Levyn] Supplies we’ll get to, but first we be missin’ a quartermaster. Ever since Samwell went rotten, me crew has never been the same. But we’ll fix that promptly, eh. Go on and take yer supplies to the ship. Return when yer done and I’ll have a quartermaster sorted out. Now make haste.

Here There Be Dragons [1/3]: Leave the basement.
Here There Be Dragons [2/3]: Go back to Indigo's Ship.
Here There Be Dragons [3/3]: Talk to Izzy belowdecks.

Here There Be Dragons: Talk to Izzy.
[Izzy] I thought Levyn was doing okay, but living under the pub must be rough. I suppose he can come along. And if finishing off a full crew is important to him, I’ve saved enough of the Council’s money to pay for a quartermaster. Would probably be worthwhile having someone care for my equipment.
[I’ll go retrieve Levyn.]
You can hear Captain Indigo shouting faintly from above.
[Captain Indigo] Don’t dilly dally, we’re ready to set off.

Here There Be Dragons: Go retrieve Levyn from the Mistport Pub Basement.

[Clarence] My chance is finally here! Pick me!
[Sarah] This is weird...
[Salty Bartender] Ye har har har!
[Samuel] Where is my food? How did I get down here?

Here There Be Dragons: Listen to Levyn's magnificent proposal.

[Levyn] Yer in for quite the treat matey, for we have options for our new quartermaster!
[Just pick one and let’s go, Izzy and Indigo are ready to leave.]
[Levyn] Not so fast landlubber, if we don’t have a top-notch quartermaster, our stuff may not be stored properly.
[How hard can the job be?]
[Levyn] I’ll let that slide as ye must not ‘ave ever had a subpar quartermaster before. I do miss me favorite peg leg so dearly.
[Levyn you have two legs.]
[Alright, let’s just get this over with.]

[Levyn] Argh it be time to meet the candidates Sukie. Let’s get this started.
[Levyn] Are ye ready to meet our first candidate?
[Doesn’t this seem like a bit much to you?]
[Levyn] Nonsense matey, I told the barkeep that Izzy be footin’ the bill with his magic money.
[Izzy didn’t agree to that.]
[Levyn] CONTESTANT NUMBER ONE: SAMWELL
[Wait Samwell is here?!]
[Not Samwell] Actually my name is Clarence. I heard that the job offers dental. I do have a few teeth I need pulled.
[We aren’t offering benefits.]
[Not Samwell] Oh well I suppose if the pay is good enough, I can manage out of pocket.
[The pay isn’t that good.]
[Not Samwell] There’s still an equal split of the treasure as advertised, right?
[What treasure???]
[Levyn] ANYWAY!
[Levyn] NEXT UP, CONTESTANT NUMBER TWO: SAMUEL
[Is that really his name?]
[Samuel] It is, but I’m actually just looking for my waiter. I’ve been waiting on my food for over an hour.
[I think Levyn closed down the pub for this.]
[Samuel] That is ridiculous! I’ve been coming to this pub every week for the past several years and never in my time here have I seen such atrocious service. I don’t care if you’ve bought out the whole town, I will not let this slide. You’ll be hearing from my attorney.
[Well that’s definitely not our quartermaster.]
[Levyn] Yer right, this guy be a dud. So let’s move on to CONTESTANT NUMBER THREE: SARAHWELL
[You’re joking, right?]
[Sarah] It’s just Sarah, I kept telling you that. Look, you don’t have to pay me much, I’m just trying to get some experience. I’ve interned with Captain Lamis before. Is that good enough?
[Sarah actually seems kind of promising.]
[Levyn] I don’t know ‘bout this one. Cheap labor usually be a bad investment.
[Are there any more contestants?]
[Levyn] Argh yer right, Samuel did quit, I s’pose we do need one more to fill out the line up. Bartender, would you like to audition as CONTESTANT NUMBER TWO?
[I regret asking already...]
[Well this will be good.]
[Salty Bartender] Zee har har I be more swashbucklin’ than the rest of ye and yer mum brined in pickle juice for a month. If there be money in it, I’ll swab ze decks like the best of ‘em.
[Ha, Levyn he might have you beat in piratey-ness.]
[This may not have been the best choice.]
[Levyn] Who does this guy think he is? The pirate stuff is a bit over the top.
[Can we just pick a quartermaster?]
[Levyn] I’ll let ye do the honors, who will it be?
[Clarence.]
[Sarah.]
[The bartender.]
[Levyn] On second thought, who knows a true pirate better than me. We’re goin with good old Samwell.
[I thought you were letting me choose?]
[Levyn] Though our budget be large, thar be no room for another one of those pesky “Branching Adventures”.
[Alright Clarence it is, it doesn’t really matter.]
[Levyn] I knew ye would come around! Let's head back ta Indigo's ship!
[Not Samwell] Thank you very much for the opportunity, I won’t let you down.

Here There Be Dragons: Head back to the Ship.

[Captain Indigo] Back at last, I see. Izzy'll be doing the introductions, I imagine. Go chat with them belowdecks.

Here There Be Dragons: Talk to Izzy.

[Levyn] Ahhh, the sweet sea air!
You are eligible to /vote on 6 sites!
[Izzy] Welcome to the ship after all that time! You must be... Samwell?
[Not Samwell] It’s Clarence actu-
[Levyn] His name be Samwell!
[Anyway, do we have all the supplies?]
[Levyn] I can hardly call these ‘ere supplies, but sure.
[Then let's sail!]
[Give me a moment, I need to prepare. It could be dangerous!]
[Izzy] Aye aye!

Here There Be Dragons: Chat with your Crew.

[Izzy] We’re arriving at the location and there appears to be an island ahead. How’s the crew doing?
[I hear Levyn’s seasick again, and “Not Samwell” gave him rum instead of medicine.]
[Izzy] They’re off to a great start I see. Are you prepared to go inland ahead of us?
[I am. What do we need to do?]
[Not yet, I need to get back to Mistport to resupply.]
[Izzy] We need to investigate this island. I suppose you can go ahead, while Clarence and I set up the ship.
[Anything in particular I should be looking for?]
[Izzy] Anything unusual I suppose. All I know is that we found traces of the Teal spirit’s magic coming from this area of the ocean. There’s got to be something weird going on. Resistance, weird doors, floating explosive spirits. Ya know. Stuff. Head up the ladder and get going!
[Levyn] Let us know once ye've found *hic* anything treasure-ish... I'll get meself up and claim some booty for meself, no matter how seasick!
[Clarence] Look, Levyn said he was feeling "briney" and I gave him what I had! How was I supposed to know the bottles were rum?!
[23:22:33] [main/WARN]: Received passengers for unknown entity

Here There Be Dragons: Venture into the City of Bones.

Here There Be Dragons: Chat with Izzy in this strange tunnel.

[Levyn] *Hic* Ye best be careful. Lookin’ dangerous here mate. Me head hurts too much ta help...
[Something’s definitely off here.]
Clarence runs into the room behind you.
[Not Samwell] I’ll scout ahead.
[Can you look for traps?]
[Levyn] No! Not Samwell! Let Sukie investigate first. They be excellent at adventurin’.
Clarence ignores Levyn and runs forward, leaping onto the nearby giant bones.
As he lands, a deep rumble sounds... and the bone collapses under him.
[Not Samwell] AHHHHHHHHH!!
[Izzy] Oh no…
[What just happened?!]
[Levyn] This weren’t meant ta happen! No! Samwell! All this time t’gether my matey, only fer ye to be taken like this. We gone through hell an’ fire, battlin’ pirates, becomin’ pirates, jailin’ folks, killin’ things... I wazzn’t ready fer this. Ye can’t leave me, mate... 
[Levyn, I don’t want to take away from this but... that wasn’t Samwell, mate.]
[Levyn] Sukie. Shut. Up. I'm not stupid. I be needin’ this. He’s gone. He’s not comin’ back, is he? Let me mourn me mate however I be needin’, right? Even losin' his replacement is stingin'. I jus' wanted the crew ta be back together one las' time...
[I... I’m sorry. I think I understand.]
[Levyn] Thank ye... 
[Izzy] Poor Clarence. Poor Levyn too. He never got over Samwell turning coat... 
[Nor I.]
[Izzy] Me either. But we have work to do right now. You need to find a way through these ruins though. Try to be safe, please? We couldn’t handle losing you too.

Here There Be Dragons: Find a way through the ruins.

Here There Be Dragons [1/2]: Find your way back into the depths of the City of Bones.
Here There Be Dragons [2/2]: Find and talk to Izzy.

[Bonafide Gatekeeper] H-hey, you! How did you get past all the guards and traps outside?!
[Apparently the guards and the traps aren't very good at their jobs.]
[Bonafide Gatekeeper] So w-what, are you here to kill us all? Take our treasure? I assure you we have none! It's just bones... all we have are bones...
[Look, just give me a key, I've got things to investigate inside.]
[Look, just give me a key. I don't care about the quest, I just wanna fight.]
[Bonafide Gatekeeper] I-I can't. It's l-lost and locked aw-way... PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!

[Izzy] This is fascinating...
[What is it?]
[Izzy] Some sort of ancient tablet with writing on it. The first language I don’t know at all, but the second seems to be the writing Bhairavi gave you to locate the Echo of Isharist. I think I can decipher this!
[Wait, you’re not going to make me do it?]
<MH> [TL] LightningGem23 » im fucking electricity
[Izzy] Of course not, this is super interesting to me, Sukie. You’re just here to defend us after all.
[Oh.]
[Izzy] Anyway, it seems to be talking about a group called the Blackflame. They used to live here, and died? After they died, another group moved in and began to worship their bones... Oh!
[What?]
[Izzy] I think those bones the city is made from were the Blackflame. They weren’t humans. They were Dragons.
[Dragons?!]
[Izzy] I don’t even think there’s any left alive. Fascinating. This tablet, which I think I’ll call the Rosetta Bone, seems to imply there’s more writings out in the city above us. Do you think you could find them? According to this, there’s three more that may help us understand how to move deeper into this area.
[Will do.]
[Why the Rosetta Bone?]
[Izzy] I once courted a lovely archaeologist named Rosetta. We still stay in contact. I bet she’d love this - and might like me more if I named it after her.

Here There Be Dragons [1/2]: Leave the Rosetta Bone and head back into the City of Bones to find three Bone Carvings.
Here There Be Dragons [2/2]: Show Izzy the Bone Carvings.

[Izzy] Have you found any carvings yet?
[Not yet.]
[Izzy] Get to it then!

[Izzy] Have you found any carvings yet?
[I found this carving. It's got a picture of a doorway on it.]
[I found this carving. It's got a symbol of a shield on it.]
[I found this carving. It has a picture of a bone on it. Recursive.]
[Izzy] Let me see if I can decipher this! Nice find!
[Let me know how it goes.]
[Izzy] Oh, this isn’t too hard. It’s talking about that gateway further in. It’s been sealed by the Blackflame worshippers and seems to be a ritual site of great importance. Something the Blackflame did is behind there, and only the most trusted can enter.
[Anything else?]
[Izzy] I don’t see anything about how to get inside on here, but it does mention a small spell at the end. I have the words, but not what magics need to be channeled or items are necessary. I doubt they knew of the Tree of Life theories either.
[That would be a surprise.]
[Izzy] Maybe some other carvings will be more useful.
[I'll see what I can find.]
[I found this carving. It's got a symbol of a shield on it.]
[I found this carving. It has a picture of a bone on it. Recursive.]
[Izzy] Aha, I think I can decipher this!
[You can handle it?]
[Izzy] Of course Sukie, I’m not useless here. Alright, let’s see…
[I’ll wait here.]
[Izzy] No need to wait. This carving speaks of another group the Blackflame Dragons had some contact with. They had some sort of pact, where they would be protected by the Blackflame in exchange for... um, I think this is saying some sort of magical shield against something called “void”?
[Interesting. I think the Conscriptorium in the Congress had something to do with void as well.]
[Izzy] I’ll have to reach out to Bhairavi then. I’d really like to know more.
[I’m sure we can see for ourselves inside. Anything on that?]
[Izzy] Nothing yet. I think there’s a component to a spell here though. I think this is just asking for a lot of crystalline shards, actually.
[I can get some of that!]
[Izzy] Maybe some other carvings will be more useful.
[I'll see what I can find.]
[I found this carving. It has a picture of a bone on it. Recursive.]
[Izzy] I believe I can read this, if you allow me a few moments!
[Take your time.]
[Izzy] Always. Now let’s see. This carving speaks of the formation of the worshippers. Following the fall of the Blackflame to an unknown cause, it seems these people were drawn to this island and to the bones of the decaying Dragons. It claims the very bones here hold power, and these followers serve only to preserve that power... “lest the void dissolve and those within break their vigil”. I have no idea what any of that means, honestly.
[Nor I.]
[Izzy] On the plus side, I see what seems to be a component here for a spell. Gold bars!
[I’ll go gather some of those.]
[Izzy] It looks like that’s all three carvings mentioned on the Rosetta Bone. We’ll need a lot of crystalline shards, some gold bars, and some magic channeled into them. Bring them to me and give them to me, and I’ll make it happen. Just trade me when you’re ready!

Here There Be Dragons: Gather two Hyper Crystalline Shards and five Gold Ingots and bring them back to Izzy.

[Izzy] Excellent. I think it’s time we go discover what’s going on inside.
HERE THERE BE DRAGONS COMPLETE!
