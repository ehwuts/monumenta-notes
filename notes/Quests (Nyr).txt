[22:14:43] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] So I've spent a bit of time away and have spoken to Vargos about your discovery and what this means for history. He's asked me to deliver a note to you and answer any questions you may have.
[22:14:43] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Great! Did he say anything interesting?]
[22:15:09] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> BlazingGamer800 » Let me get this straight: I'm supposed to bring the crystal to Cinevra after saving Eldim, right?
[22:15:14] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] He gave me more information on the Wools now that we know they'll be tied up in my future research. He also gave me a new task. Maybe I'll have you help with that too.

[22:16:07] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Do you have any questions?
[22:16:07] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [So who was C'Zanil? How did he make the curses?]
[22:16:07] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [What power has the White Wool granted me?]
[22:16:07] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [What was Quetzalcoatl really?]
[22:16:07] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Can I have another copy of Vargos' letter?]
[22:16:07] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [You mentioned more research and me helping with it before....]
[22:16:40] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] None directly, but there is more potential within you now. If you return to the Academy, you should be able to channel that power into another skill of your choice.

[22:16:46] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [You mentioned more research and me helping with it before....]
[22:16:59] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] He was a Tlaxan Shaman - a leader of the Tlaxan people - during the Blackroot War. His role, according to our research, was to capture the souls of the dead and twist them into deadly magics using the White Wool.

[22:17:01] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [You mentioned more research and me helping with it before....]
[22:17:03] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] From what you told me, it seems there is no god called Quetzalcoatl at all. I believe that the Tlaxans worshiped the Wool they had as Gods and gave them names.

[22:17:12] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [You mentioned more research and me helping with it before....]
[22:17:14] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Ah, yes. I've been doing further research into the Shamans, C'Zanil in particular. You see, while the other two Shamans, C'Axtal and C'Shura, seem to be held in fairly high regard still within Tlaxan culture, C'Zanil is a different story.
[22:17:14] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Why do you say that?]
[22:17:15] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] His tomb has been lost. I know of monuments to C'Axtal and C'Shura hidden among Tlaxan-kept locations, but C'Zanil has almost been erased from their society.
[22:17:15] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [So what can I do to help?]
[22:17:15] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Unfortunately I'm a bit preoccupied right now. Maybe I can help later?]
[22:17:17] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Ah, so there's a bit more left to tell you. You see, just a few days ago, my team and I found C'Zanil's tomb.
[22:17:17] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Your team?]
[22:17:17] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [That's nice.]
[22:17:17] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [That seems like a bit of a big deal.]
[22:17:18] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] KarlStrauss left the game
[22:17:23] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] I've been assigned a crew of workers and mages to help me in my research. Those on the Mage Council have privileges I suppose.
[22:17:23] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Seems like it. So you found the tomb then?]
[22:17:24] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Indeed. My team is in the midst of excavating the cave entrance and trying to find a way inside. Do you think you could help them - and me - out?
[22:17:24] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'm in.]
[22:17:24] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Maybe later. This seems like a lot of work.]
[22:17:25] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] CatProductions left the game
[22:17:43] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Fantastic news. You'll find my team east from the Ziggurat you fought through during our last adventure. They're down the cliff, just outside the ancient ruins. My lead excavator's name is Pten, speak to him.
[22:17:43] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] QUEST : BEASTS OF MEN

[22:17:43] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Difficulty : Medium
[22:17:43] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Meet Bhairavi's assistant, Pten, outside the Ancient Ruins, east of the Tlaxan Ziggurat.
[22:17:43] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Let me know when you've found something important! I'll be continuing my research here. I'm trying to find out more about Tlaxan culture.

[22:18:55] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Beasts of Men: Meet Bhairavi's assistant, Pten near the Ancient Ruins.

~(362, 72, -127)

[22:23:31] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] Headlamps, check. Rope, check. Pickaxes, check. Sheets, check...
[22:23:31] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] He ignores you and keeps sorting supplies.
[22:23:38] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Antigone] Unless you know how to blast into this tomb, please move along. I'm quite busy.
[22:23:53] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] Hello? Who are you and why are you here?
[22:23:53] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'm Sukie. Bhairavi sent me here to assist your excavation.]
[22:23:55] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] Oh, are you the adventurer that helped her out with the Battlefield project? You found the White Wool?
[22:23:55] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I am!]
[22:23:58] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] Pleasure to meet you then. I'm Pten, lead excavator under Bhairavi. We've been hard at work clearing out this sealed off area.
[22:23:58] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi told me you found C'Zanil's crypt.]
[22:24:01] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] We have indeed found his crypt. It's quite an interesting story actually... All this research actually paid off. Are you interested in hearing it, or would you rather just get to what my crew actually needs help with?
[22:24:01] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Please, tell me more.]
[22:24:01] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I don't have time for long explanations. Let's get to work.]
[22:24:13] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] So, as I assume you know, C'Zanil was a key part of the Blackroot War for the Tlaxans. What we know now however is that C'Zanil fell into disgrace after the war ended. His nasty magics caused a breakdown in the efforts after the surrender.
[22:24:13] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [How so?]
[22:24:24] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] We believe devotees of C'Zanil's ways broke off from the Tlaxans seeking peace and formed their own group. C'Zanil didn't condone their actions, and was the last Shaman to remain after the war. C'Axtal and C'Shura seem to have vanished during the conflict.
[22:24:24] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [And?]
[22:24:35] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] It seems the Tlaxans shunned him. He fled to his workshop. We wanted to find it. Now here we are!
[22:24:35] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I wonder what happened to the other Shamans.]
[22:24:39] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] We do too, but this place here is more important. It became C'Zanil's tomb. Bhairavi feels fairly sure that after C'Shura vanished, C'Zanil gained control of an artifact she possessed originally. Bhairavi now believes that was the Orange Wool. If we can get inside this place, maybe we can find the wool inside!
[22:24:39] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [So how do we get inside then?]
[22:24:49] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] Ah! Such a gung ho attitude! I love it! We absolutely need to get inside. So here's the deal. It seems that the place is sealed off by three keys, each one related to one of the tribes of Beastmen that roam the jungle.
[22:24:49] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Beastmen?]
[22:24:49] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I know the Beastmen. Where do I need to go?]
[22:24:51] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] Yes. They're tribes of what used to be humans, but they seem to be more than that now. Hawk, Jaguar, and Serpentsia - though the Serpentsia seem to have been driven into extinction. They seem to be connected to this. Reports indicate they fought alongside C'Shura during the war, so we're not sure why they'd guard C'Zanil's tomb.
[22:24:51] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [What do you need me to do then?]
[22:24:54] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Mikara_ left the game
[22:24:55] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] I need you to hunt down the remaining keys. My crew bravely managed to obtain the key guarded by the Jaguars, albeit at quite a loss of life. We still need the Hawk and Serpentsia keys.
[22:24:55] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Any idea which camps I'll need to visit?]
[22:24:56] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] So we know the two keys left are for the Hawks and for the Serpentsia.
[22:24:56] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where is the Hawk key?]
[22:24:56] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where is the Serpentsia key?]
[22:24:57] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] So we're fairly sure that the Hawk key is within a Hawk village just near the Tlaxan Ziggurat you found the Halls of Wind and Blood below.
[22:24:57] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Thanks. I'll get on it now!]
[22:24:58] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] Return to me when you have both keys!
[22:25:01] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] So we know the two keys left are for the Hawks and for the Serpentsia.
[22:25:01] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where is the Hawk key?]
[22:25:01] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where is the Serpentsia key?]
[22:25:04] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] We're less sure about the Serpentsia key's location. In her research, Bhairavi heard mention of somewhere called the Serpent Ruins across the river near Nyr. Maybe try there?
[22:25:04] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Thanks! I'll get on that now.]
[22:25:05] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] Return to me when you have both keys!

[22:28:19] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Beasts of Men [1/3]: Get the Hawk key from the Hawk Village.
[22:28:22] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Beasts of Men [2/3]: Get the Serpentsia key from the Serpent Ruins high on the clifftop.
[22:57:52] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Beasts of Men [2/3]: Get the Serpentsia key from the Serpent Ruins high on the clifftop.
[22:57:53] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Beasts of Men [3/3]: Talk to Pten near the Ancient Ruins once you find both keys.

[23:12:36] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] You found them both! You're really serious about this adventuring thing. Let me place the keys in their slots then, and we'll see what happens...
[23:12:36] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] It worked! It looks like the crypt has actually opened up... I'll gather my crew and send some people inside. Would you like to do the honors and enter first?
[23:12:36] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Absolutely. I'll meet you down there.]
[23:12:36] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I need to go prepare first. Who knows what's inside?]
[23:12:45] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] This is so exciting! Bhairavi will be so pleased.

[23:14:03] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] Hey there! You're Sukie, right? I just finished setting up the forward camp here. Not sure what to expect so I wanted us to be ready. My colleagues are exploring some various entrances found around the outer ring.
[23:14:03] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where do those entrances go?]
[23:14:07] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] From what we can tell, they're tombs to important supporters of C'Zanil. Each is labeled, and seems to contain some sort of puzzle.
[23:14:07] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Have you guys been able to solve any of them?]
[23:14:08] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] Brayllur and Keller seemed to have some degree of success. You'll want to speak to those stationed outside each room for more details. I was put in charge of the central chamber. Anything else you'd like to know?
[23:14:08] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [How do I get out?]
[23:14:08] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where is C'Zanil's tomb?]

[23:14:21] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] Aha, the real question! So opposite the stairs leading to the outer ring is a set of stairs going downward. At the bottom is a sealed gate we've been unable to get through. There's an inscription on it that implies you need to "appease" his followers to gain entry. So I guess we have to solve the puzzles!

[23:14:25] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] He went off to submit a report to Bhairavi! If he's not already down here, I'm sure he will be soon. He said he'd be making a beeline to C'Zanil's tomb!
[23:15:04] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] Hi there. Glad to see you made it down here too. I just spoke to Bhairavi and she's blown away by our progress! We need to get inside C'Zanil's tomb itself, because of course he has more than one layer of security. It seems his four most trusted generals created trials for those wishing to enter. We'll have to get through them all, I guess!
[23:15:04] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [What do I need to do?]
[23:15:05] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] I've sent a few of my coworkers to check them out in more detail. Go talk to them and they should be able to help you out. Come back to me when you're done!

[23:17:20] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Brayllur] Hello. You are Sukie.
[23:17:20] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I am.]
[23:17:22] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Brayllur] I am Brayllur. I am fighter for Bhairavi. This is warrior tomb, so I am here.
[23:17:22] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [What am I to expect in the next room?]
[23:17:27] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Brayllur] It is battle arena. Inside is fighter you must beat. I have bested it, but I am no bow man. I need all four challenges to enter Zanil-man's tomb. Maybe you do it? Watch out for fighter's charge. It hurt.

[23:20:27] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Arvaya] A challenger? I shall watch eagerly from the stands.
[23:21:40] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Arvaya] You fight with the strength of C'Shura...
[23:36:17] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Brayllur] You do very well. I explore arena deeply for more information. Maybe new weapons too. Thanks.

[23:23:18] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Keller] Hey buddy. I'm Keller. You're Sukie right?
[23:23:18] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Yep!]
[23:23:20] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Keller] This place is crazy, eh? Reminds me of the big open room inside the Halls of Wind and Blood. I guess C'Zanil had a hand in building them both.
[23:23:20] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [You've been in there too?]
[23:23:25] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Keller] Only briefly. I'm not much of a fighter. I'm more of a household magic user. Nowhere near the level of the Mage Council. This little puzzle in here was right up my alley! I managed to complete it a few minutes ago... but it seems we have to solve all four puzzles to progress. I'll never beat Arvaya in combat!
[23:23:25] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Can I help?]
[23:23:36] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Keller] Absolutely! It's some kind of magical light system. It sends out a pattern, and you need to repeat it. You'll need as good a memory as mine! Or just write it down... why didn't I think of that before...

[23:26:58] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Congratulations! You solved it!
[23:26:58] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Siershen] That was a truly magical performance...
[23:35:42] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Keller] Hey! You did it! Amazing stuff, friend. I can't wait to try and understand how this all works...

[23:28:41] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Starn] Definitely. Looks like someone called Cyrar was an archer for C'Zanil. Inside are three absurdly challenging bow shots you'll need to make. I've got neither the disposition nor the talent to hit them. Been trying! Hit them all and I guess you'll "appease the spirit" or whatever.

[23:37:13] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Antigone] Lovely to meet you, and apologies for my brusqueness earlier. I am Antigone. I'm Bhairavi's alchemist and demolitions expert. Before you is the tomb of what seems to be C'Zanil's most trusted Alchemist, named Selxen. Inside is some sort of alchemy logic puzzle. I'm still trying to work out the details, but feel free to try it yourself.
[23:37:13] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Any hints?]
[23:37:15] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Antigone] I believe it has multiple aspects. First you will need to brew a potion; that central brewing stand is primed and ready. After that, you'll have work out what comes next.

[00:00:00] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Correct Solution
[00:00:00] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Selxem] How did you survive my poison? Impressive...

[00:00:57] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Antigone] Well, I am duly impressed. Excellent solving skills. I'm eager to dig into the inner workings of this challenge, there's much to learn about Selxem and Tlaxan potion making here.

[00:01:54] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] I can feel an intense magic on you, Sukie. Have you really done it?
[00:01:54] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I have, with the help of your coworkers!]
[00:01:54] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Absolutely. Did you doubt me?]
[00:01:58] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Pten] I'm glad they were of help! I think it's time we try entering the tomb then... Could the wool be inside?

[00:11:22] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Found anything important yet? My research has been going well up here.
[00:11:22] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I have! With Pten and his crew's help we got inside the crypt!]
[00:11:26] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] You really are the one to bet on, aren't you? Did you find anything in there?
[00:11:26] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [A few books... and also the location of the Orange Wool. It's inside the tunnels below the Serpent Ruins!]
[00:11:29] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] That's big news! Are you preparing to head there now?
[00:11:29] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Yes, I am.]

[00:11:29] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Not now.]
[00:11:33] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] I'll send you some help and construct a lobby like I did for the Halls of Wind and Blood.

[13:28:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] Oh thank god, I'm alive. You are too. This is good. Bhairavi sent me here ahead of the rest of the team - I'm to offer you supplies as well as a reward for discovering this place. This is really amazing. How did C'Zanil build all this stuff?
[13:28:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I really don't know.]
[13:29:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] Anyway, I found a really interesting item back in the tomb that I wanted to give to you. Also, I have a key for you to access this place. They call it the Fallen Menagerie. Good luck in there. I hope you can find the wool!

[20:58:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Definitely not! With that in mind, where can I get more?]
[20:58:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Master of Clucks] I imagine speaking to your Poultrygeist ALLY would make sense. Want to try and visit him now?

[12:59:39] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Dr. Laurie] An outbreak of Marasmus Execratio, or the 'Blackroot Plague' as it's colloquially known. I won't go into the details, but it is both resoundingly unpleasant and fatal to two-thirds of the infected. Worst of all, none of my drugs work against it.
[12:59:39] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Can anything be done?]
[12:59:39] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wow, that sounds nasty]

[12:59:52] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Dr. Laurie] Some Tlaxani say their shamans could brew medicine that can cure it. It's a longshot, but there's four lives on the line. If you can find a shaman who can make that medicine, bring me back five doses; four for them, and one more so I can learn how to make it myself.

[13:20:29] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] The Plague [1/2]: C'Taz needs exactly 12 dark amber for the first ingredient of the medicine, hidden within a massive tree.

[17:22:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [C'Taz] Perfect. Dark Amber, to be ground into a powder as fine as the smoothest sand. Next, we need sixteen Spirit Flowers, plucked from an island deep in the jungle. Their ancient oils banish the foul spirits afflicting Nyr.

[17:23:10] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Plague [1/2]: Next C'Taz needs precisely 16 spirit flowers from the hallowed pond east of her hut.

[17:29:17] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Plague [1/2]: Finally, bring C'Taz 10 pieces of Haunted Earth from the dangerous ruins northeast of Nyr and northwest of Farr.

[01:47:15] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Can I have another copy of Vargos' letter?]
[01:47:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] From what you told me, it seems there is no god called Quetzalcoatl at all. I believe that the Tlaxans worshiped the Wool they had as Gods and gave them names. We also know of Ixume and Myragh, which seem to personify the Orange and Magenta wool as well. The Lunatic's myth that you found also implies magic is tied to a Light Blue wool, and the being Kaul is involved with Yellow.

[01:48:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] They appear to be other Tlaxan Shamans. The Vault you accessed had books with their names too, if I recall correctly. It seems C'Axtal was involved with a Sanctum that was destroyed, and C'Shura was sent to deal with it, leaving C'Zanil with both the White and Orange wools.

[01:48:18] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What can I do?]
[01:48:28] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] I think we'd be best served having you assist with the Myragh research. We've made some major breakthroughs on that front and are working on finding the Plagueroot Temple mentioned in Selxem's tomb.
[01:48:28] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where is it?]
[01:48:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Ah, well there's the kicker. We have reason to believe it is within the Grand Maw, one of the most dangerous places in the King's Valley.
[01:48:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Oh...]
[01:48:38] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] It's a bit of an undertaking. I understand. So you're in right?

[01:48:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] I know it's a bit of an open prompt, but just explore around the Maw. Perhaps we'll find a book, maybe more graves. Anything could help. If you can bring back what you find, even better. Please be careful though. The book we found seems ominous and the Temple seems dangerous.
[01:48:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where is the Grand Maw?]
[01:48:56] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Oh! I didn't even consider you didn't know of it. Head out of Nyr to the river, and follow it into the jungle. The river itself pours into the Maw. You can't miss it.

[02:39:35] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [So now what?]
[02:39:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] We can fix this. I know we can. Go talk to Dr. Laurie. She's going to need all the help she can get.

[02:40:15] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Dr. Laurie] Oh, thank goodness, it's you. Things are really bad. I've been in contact with Bhairavi and she told me you should be able to help. I have no idea how this outbreak happened and the medicine you helped me get isn't working at all, according to Nurse Eris.
[02:40:15] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Actually, I know why it happened.]
[02:40:15] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [We're clueless as to why the Plague happened as well.]
[02:40:27] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Dr. Laurie] Don't worry about it right now. We can discuss that when people aren't dying. We need to find a new cure, and I think I have a contact we can get some help from. There's a bit of a problem though...
[02:40:27] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What's the problem?]
[02:40:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Dr. Laurie] He lives in Farr. If we want to get in contact with him, you'll have to sneak into Farr. It's going to be dangerous. The crown has set up a full quarantine and has guards stationed across the city. If you get caught, you're going to be in serious trouble.
[02:40:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [This sounds like my kind of challenge.]
[02:40:54] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Dr. Laurie] Good. My contact's name is T'Lm - he's an ex-village leader of the Tlaxans. He lives with his son, Haotl, on the west side of the town, near the armory. I hope he's not sick or trapped outside the city.
[02:40:54] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [How am I going to get into Farr?]
[02:41:03] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Dr. Laurie] The city has to drain water somewhere, right? I'd check on the west side, by the Hallowed Pond. Maybe there is a sewer entrance hidden nearby.

[02:52:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [T'Lm] I... I am. Are you here to take me away like my son?
[02:52:52] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [No, I was sent by Bhairavi and Dr. Laurie. They said you might be able to help me.]
[02:52:57] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [T'Lm] Help you? I've not heard from Bhairavi in quite awhile. Did they send you to help with Marasmus Execratio?
[02:52:57] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Yes. I found a crystal in the Grand Maw, and when I took it, all this happened.]
[02:53:04] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [T'Lm] You took one of the sacred binding crystals? No wonder Myragh has been unleashed. You must be fixing this mistake quickly, Sukie.
[02:53:04] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [How do you know my name?]
[02:53:04] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [How do I fix this?]
[02:53:10] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [T'Lm] There is much I know. I know of Velara below. I know of the Shamans before. I know of villages hidden away. I know of other wool, out of time and place. There is much you want to know. There is much you will learn, in time. For now though, you must fix Myragh.
[02:53:10] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [How?]
[02:53:18] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [T'Lm] Below the city are sewers. One such door within there leads to the ruins of the Tlaxan settlement known as Velara, hidden below this place. Velara's magic is strong, and grew crystals that could be infused with magic. Go within. Get a crystal. Return to me.

[02:53:44] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Roots of the Plague: Find the door that leads to the ruins of Velara. Make your way through the ruins and find a crystal. You will need to be in quarantined Farr.

[03:07:31] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I got a Pure Crystal.]
[03:07:35] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [T'Lm] Excellent. Your work is not yet done though. Nurse Eris has been slaving away over a cure. Bring her this crystal. Ask her to anoint it with C'Taz's cure. Then, bring the crystal to the Grand Maw. Myragh will be contained again. My son will be saved... Be warned though, getting to Eris' will require some serious sneaking. The guards are carefully stationed...

[01:08:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi]  So you were attacked by a man, this relic was taken from you, and you woke up in Sierhaven? I wonder how you got there... Who were you, Sukie? Who found you? I think we need to go talk to Commander Haynes upstairs. Maybe she will know more.

[01:08:40] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Soul of the Forest: Speak with Commander Haynes

[01:09:25] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] I'll let you speak to Haynes first. We have much to discuss.
[01:09:27] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] Hello Sukie. It’s good to see you again after all your help. Likewise to you Bhairavi. It’s always an honor to have a member of the Mage Council visit Highwatch.
[01:09:29] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Thank you, Commander. We are here seeking information about the Sons of the Forest and Sukie themself... Did any of the King’s Guard find a near-dead adventurer recently and deliver them to Nurse Diedre in the capital?
[01:09:32] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] I'd honestly have to check our records... Give me a minute here. The paperwork is so messy. Starn and I had no time to go through it.
[01:09:37] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] The only record I can find of a body found that wasn’t dead recently was of a person found north east of Farr. It says here they were found in a small ruin overlooking the large pit with a 'shrine' inside. Maybe that was you Sukie?
[01:09:37] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Maybe it was. I’ve never found it again during my adventures.]
[01:09:37] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Probably, I die a lot.]
[01:09:37] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [It could be. I never bothered to look for it again.]
[01:10:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] This seems worth investigating… Perhaps you can find out more about the artifact and how we can use it there.
[01:10:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sounds like these ruins outside the pit are my next stop then.]
[01:10:17] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Thanks for your help Haynes.
[01:10:20] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Commander Haynes] Of course. It is my honor.

[01:10:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Soul of the Forest: Investigate the ruins overlooking the pit near Farr.

[01:10:25] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] You should head to the huge shrine in the pit east of Farr and investigate around the edges for a smaller shrine. It could hold answers to both your past and to the Sons' plans. I'll send someone to assist you as soon as possible.

[01:42:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Brayllur] Hullo. I am sent to try help. Bharavi say it be dangerous here, she expect. I am fighter man, you know that.

The Battlefield outside Nyr is the remnants of the final battle that resulted in the Tlaxan surrender, but is still riddled with curses. This is due to the vile magics the Tlaxans cast that are stronger than any other I've seen. If you wish to know more, Sumona in Lowtide might have a book or two on the subject.

[17:38:13] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Difficulty : Easy
[17:38:13] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Take Bhairavi's creation and break a curse on the Battlefield.
[17:38:13] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] So, about my creation. I've made what I'm calling the Topographic Curse Sensor, a spelled-up Flower that can detect and shatter curses with the right prompting. When you're ready, I can activate it and you should be able to follow traces of magic to a curse!
[17:38:13] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'm ready!]
[17:38:13] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I need a few minutes to prepare.]

[17:38:21] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> [WAIFU] Darmorel » basicly
[17:38:35] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Excellent. Let's send you off then. You'll need to hold it while out on the battlefield. If you see any odd remnants of magic, try hitting them with the Sensor! The curse traps spirits on the battlefield, so if you can go through them and find the source, I'd be quite pleased!

[17:43:16] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Gypsum the Scout] Hello? Can you hear me?
[17:43:16] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Who's there?!]
[17:43:18] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Gypsum the Scout] My name is Gypsum. I used to be a scout for the crown. I've been trapped here for decades, doomed to wander the remnants of the battlefield.
[17:43:18] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [So you're a ghost?]
[17:43:22] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Gypsum the Scout] Something like that. I've been cursed!
[17:43:22] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'm here to break a curse actually. Do you know anything about it?]
[17:43:24] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Gypsum the Scout] I don't, I'm sorry. My fellow Scout, Darius, might know more. He often can be found in the ruins to the south of here.

[17:45:28] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Darius the Scout] Hello? Are you actually looking at me?
[17:45:28] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Yes! Hello? Are you Darius?]
[17:45:28] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [No.]
[17:45:33] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Darius the Scout] I am! How do you know my name?
[17:45:33] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [The other ghost scout told me about the curse and sent me to you.]
[17:45:36] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> [LAG] VastPoenBV » It did give me Enderwrath though that cool
[17:45:36] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Darius the Scout] Oh! I don't know much. I just remember our forces captured a Tlaxan Ritualist who screamed about a curse. I never did find out where it originated from.
[17:45:36] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Darn. Thanks for your help.]
[17:45:43] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Darius the Scout] I hope you find the source. I'd love to go free someday... Hey, my fellow Scout, Rethus, is over on the catapult. Maybe she knows more.

[17:47:54] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Rethus the Scout] Woooo! Woooooooo!
[17:47:54] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Ah! A ghost!]
[17:47:57] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Rethus the Scout] Did I get you?
[17:47:57] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Definitely.]
[17:47:57] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [No. Your friend Darius sent me to find you though.]
[17:48:01] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Rethus the Scout] Thank goodness. I always appreciate a bit of fun these days.
[17:48:01] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Rethus the Scout] Anyway, what can I do for you?
[17:48:01] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I was sent to you by another ghost. I'm looking for the source of a curse that I've been tasked to break.]
[17:48:05] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Rethus the Scout] Oh! That would be incredible! At last, we could be free!
[17:48:05] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Do you know where the curse on you originates from?]
[17:48:07] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Rethus the Scout] I don't know exactly where it is, but I know inside the Ruined Mansion over there is a hidden Vault. Our forces had captured a dangerous Tlaxan who swore to put a curse on us. They were stopped and interrogated, but I believe an item taken from them was placed in the Vault. It may have something to do with the curse.
[17:48:07] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Thank you so much for your help. I'll go see what I can find.]
[17:48:25] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Rethus the Scout] Best of luck. I hope you can break the curse. Imagining freedom is almost too much for me. I cannot wait.

#Q23I03
[17:56:37] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] You feel a rush of power as a curse shatters around you.

[18:00:52] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Have you broken any curses yet?
[18:00:52] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I have!]
[18:00:54] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] My creation worked? Did you find anything?
[18:00:54] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [It did work, and I found a few interesting things. This curse was inside a Vault, and I found some books and this strange bottle. Have a look.]
[18:00:56] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> [WAIFU] Darmorel » lol
[18:00:59] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Hmm. This text is fascinating. C'Zanil the Soulcrusher. I know of him well. He was a major force behind the Blackroot War. He must have created this bottle of souls too; that was his specialty. Let me take a look inside...
[18:00:59] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Go for it.]
[18:01:06] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Oh god. Oh no. No no no no no.
[18:01:06] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [What is it?]
[18:01:08] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] No wonder the Ritualist wasn't afraid. This bottle should have exploded years ago. There is enough power in here to level the entirety of the King's Valley. And I just opened it.
[18:01:08] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [That sounds bad...]
[18:01:14] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] This is really bad! The spirits are coming out and gathering. You need to take this. Follow the spirits. Bring them to their source. QUICKLY! If you do not, we all die.
[18:01:14] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where am I going?!]
[18:01:16] [Render thread/WARN]: Unknown custom packed identifier: venturechat:data
[18:01:20] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] You will know. The spirits will guide you. Hurry! Let the winds of war carry you to the Halls of Wind and Blood. We can neutralize the bottle and find out what's inside all at once.
[18:01:20] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'm ready to go.]
[18:01:20] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hang on! I'm not ready yet! It could be dangerous!]
[18:01:23] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> [WAIFU] KarlStrauss » i is here
[18:01:25] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <G> [WAIFU] Darmorel » there a chest that I put on top of my plot some time ago... because it on the barriers themselves, I cant break it

[18:04:32] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] You did it! Quick, head down the ladder before you - power is radiating from within!

[18:33:05] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] You made it! I see the Bottle of Souls has gone inert as well. Excellent. They must have dissipated within the temple.
[18:33:05] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Whoa, how are you here?]
[18:33:07] [Render thread/WARN]: Received passengers for unknown entity
[18:33:11] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] I'm projecting myself into the space near you. Actually I'm projecting the whole space as well. You almost entered right into the Halls of Wind and Blood, so I've set up this little lobby to keep you safe as you prepare for what's inside.
[18:33:11] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [That's pretty interesting. Thank you.]
[18:33:21] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] No, thank you for your help. You've done everything I've asked and more. I believe now is the time I should reward you, before I ask you to go inside the temple and recover what's within.
