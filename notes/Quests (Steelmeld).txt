[16:38:18] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] Oh hello there. Sorry, I don't have much time to talk right now, I'm pretty busy.
[16:38:18] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where does this passage way lead?]
[16:38:18] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Who are you?]
[16:38:23] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] Well, that's the question, now isn't it! You don't seem like you're from around here, mind if I ask who you are?
[16:38:23] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [My name is Sukie.]
[16:38:23] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I do mind actually!]
[16:38:28] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] Sukie, what an interesting name. Well Sukie, a recent collapse in a structured wall in the garden revealed this passage way, and I've tasked myself with researching what lies beyond it.
[16:38:28] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Is there something preventing you from going forward?]
[16:38:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] You mean besides the large iron bars and the obvious signs of structural foundation erosion? Yes actually, there's also a powerful seal keeping the area inaccessible.
[16:38:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Would you like some help?]
[16:38:38] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] Hmm, I've not hired an assistant in a while... not since the accident that, uh... terminated my last one... So sure, why not! You're hired!

[16:38:38] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] Assist Fred in researching the passageway in Steelmeld.
[16:38:38] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [So what's the plan?]
[16:38:40] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] Here's a little catch up on my research so far. After some careful study on the seal that prevents forward progress, I have found that it might be possible to counter the magical frequency using a Silvic Crystal.
[16:38:40] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] Since I'm sure you've brushed up on your geology like all good assistants do, you likely know that Silvic Crystals are exceedingly rare. In fact, the only place I even know they can be found is an area in the west known as the Crystalline Vault, though not many people are brave enough to attempt to enter.
[16:38:40] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [So in short, find the magic crystal in the dangerous vault?]
[16:38:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] As sharp as I would expect! Let us head there forthwith!
[16:38:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Us?]
[16:38:44] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] Yes, us! Why would I not come with you? Have your previous employers sent you off to dangerous places on your own? How careless!

[02:49:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Professor Bermuda] Well, to answer your question: Before the infamous Calder became a wanted criminal across King▒s Valley and the Celsian Isles, he was a genius that created portable apportation runes. His work inspired Lady Fulgarc▒s work, and Lady Fulgarc▒s work inspired mine! So I will honor his work as a researcher with this device.

[03:37:11] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Professor Bermuda] Thank goodness you're safe! You flung yourself towards the reward but got caught in a dimensional loophole. If I hadn't caught you before you fell into the hole completely▒ Anyways! You did an excellent job.
[03:37:11] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What do we do now?]

==The Olive Branch==
[14:55:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Sukie, I’ve got news regarding the spirit from the Teal Wool.
[14:55:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [You do?]
[14:55:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Can you help me understand what happened inside Isharist?]
[14:55:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Can I have another copy of your research?]
[14:55:05] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] I do. Vargos and I called a meeting of the Mage Council and began an intense magic search across the region. I called in a few of my assistants, and I believe we’ve found things.
[14:55:05] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Like what?]
[14:55:16] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Well, firstly, there’s a strange disturbance of magic going on under the town of Nightroost. Wexley said it was like… a song? Anyway, the spirit was absolutely involved, but is gone.
[14:55:16] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [That's all? Want me to go check it out?]
[14:55:17] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Oh, not at all. It's worse. The spirit has been active almost everywhere. We've been finding little time anomalies breaking through and creating some strangeness. But it's all been leading right to the center of the isles, to the ruins of the Congress.
[14:55:17] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Oh no. That can't be good.]
[14:55:18] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] No, it cannot. The Council is well aware of the Congress, you see. We've exchanged research with them before, and they were known to have the most extensive magical research on any topic, ever. Their exhibits were unrivaled. And according to Antigone, there's wool magic radiating from it like crazy.
[14:55:18] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [So you want me to go inside again?]
[14:55:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Yes I do. Into the real Congress, not just a collapsing room, as well. Also, we're coming with you. Are you in?
[14:55:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'm in. Also what? You're coming with me? Bhairavi, it's dangerous.]
[14:55:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'm not sure I'm ready for this right now.]
[14:55:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Of course it is. But I'm tired of sending you into danger alone. This is a unique situation Sukie and you're going to need my full team's experience in there.

[15:01:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] Hello Sukie! It's been far too long. I've not seen you since the Menagerie in the King's Valley. But sorry, we don't have a lot of time to chat. This area seems to be where the Teal spirit's influence can be felt.
[15:01:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I see that. It looks... pristine here. So, do you have any idea how to get in? Or should we just go down the shaft in the center?]

[15:02:04] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Olive Branch: Find Wexley at the Ruins of the Congress.

[15:02:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] I've already checked out that other path and didn't see any way to get further yet. There's a weird misty barrier I can't pass, so this door seems to be our best bet. It looks very out of place! Maybe we can break it down?
[15:02:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I don't know about that.]
[15:02:09] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] Come on, you're strong! Brayllur says so! Give it a shot.

[15:02:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Olive Branch: Find Wexley at the Ruins of the Congress.

[15:02:14] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] Go on! Punch the door!
[15:02:17] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You punch the door. It doesn't seem to do much, other than hurt your hand.
[15:02:19] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] For some reason you decide to punch the door again. It hurts your hand. Ouch.

[15:02:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] Hmm, that didn't work. Let me see if I can do this correctly... Once I'm done, quickly turn and hit the door. It won't last long.
[15:02:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] He speaks some... words. They make your brain hurt and you can't seem to remember them.
[15:02:22] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] Okay, try punching the door again.
[15:02:26] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You punch the door again. It quivers, but remains in place.

[15:02:31] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] No, I think I did that a bit wrong... Let me try again. Once again, as soon as I cast this, quickly, hit the door.
[15:02:31] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [You must be joking.]
[15:02:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] Of course not, we got this!
[15:02:33] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] He speaks some noises more emphatically this time. They melt out of your head almost as quickly as you hear them.

[15:02:35] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Olive Branch: It'll definitely work this time. Break down the door!

[15:02:37] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] You punch the door again. It remains closed. Like it's taunting you.

[15:03:07] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Olive Branch: Talk to Hargraves, the man behind the door.

[15:03:27] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] How does this place still exist? This reminds me of what Keller told me about the Argone Scholar's time bubble you all broke into. Could the Teal Spirit have done this?
[15:03:27] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I don't know, but maybe this can get us deeper into the Congress to investigate more.]
[15:03:34] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Wexley] Absolutely. Let's go talk to our guard over there.

[15:03:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hargraves] Well hello. I don't recognize you. New to the Congress?
[15:03:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Let's say that.]
[15:03:43] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hargraves] Excellent, always nice to have a new face around. Look, I'm supposed to organize the test tubes in the walls around us, but damn, it's proper tough this time. If you can do it for me, I'll send you off to the Forum to deliver the reports and you can have the rest of the day off. Sound good?
[15:03:43] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I'm in. How does this work?]
[15:03:46] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hargraves] Okay, so in these eight tubes are a number of reagent blocks. You can take the top block, one at a time, and put them into another tube. However, the block can only go into a tube if the next block down shares a color with it, or the tube is completely empty. Your goal is to get all seven colors into their own tubes, four blocks of a color per tube.
[15:03:46] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sounds complicated. I'll give it a go.]
[15:03:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hargraves] Great! Thank goodness, I wasn't looking forward to leaving my desk.

[15:03:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Olive Branch: Solve the reagents puzzle.

[15:05:50] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hargraves] Hey! You did it! Let me write up a report real quick... Head back out this door and down the spiral staircase into the Labs. You should be able to get into the main Forum and deliver this to Professor Marin. Do you have an access pass?
[15:05:50] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Not yet. I was uh, supposed to get one though.]
[15:05:53] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hargraves] That's fine, I'll cast it onto you. Here you go then and thanks for your help.

[15:05:57] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Olive Branch: Leave the reagents room with your report!

[15:05:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hargraves] Off to the main Forum with you! Look for Professor Marin!
[15:05:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I uh... lost that book.]
[15:06:01] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Hargraves] Oh! No you didn't. You left it here on my desk. Here you go.

[15:06:58] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Professor Marin] Oh wonderful. I've been waiting for these reagent logs all week. Here, take this key. It should get you further into the Forum. You can get some refreshments before you head back to work.

[15:08:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I was in some other time anomaly, I think. I spoke to a professor, and then I think the Teal Spirit spoke to me. It sent me here, but I have a key to the Forum now.]
[15:09:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] Fascinating. Teal's influence seems incredibly unstable. But with you back, it looks like it's time to get started then. Shall we head inside? I'll send my team ahead to secure various points and try and assist you in your dungeoneering. I've been to the Congress before, but am not sure what to expect inside following the explosion.

[15:09:16] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Olive Branch: You have found the Fallen Forum. When ready, take a key and enter the dungeon.

[03:58:06] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] That was intense. Sukie, we’ve learned so much.
[03:58:06] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [We’re no closer to catching Teal though.]
[03:58:07] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] We’re not, but we know something now. The spirit is ensuring it is destroyed by Maxwell Calder. You heard what it said. It’s meddling with time now. How many events has it been playing with over the years? Is this the first, or just one of many? I must begin researching; this is a lot to take in.
[03:58:07] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Can I help?]
[03:58:08] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Bhairavi] As soon as I know more, you’ll be the first person I call. Incredible work in there.

[17:08:44] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] That's... incredible is an understatement. This... this is outstanding, Sukie! This is exactly what I needed to know, I'll have no issue completing my research now, and I think I know the next step.
[17:08:44] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] So, how you entered the Willows- a doorway would be a good way to describe it, yes? I need you to go back to that doorway and gather information. Here, take this- I fashioned it with one of the Silvic Crystals we snagged from that vault. When you get to the area near the doorway, activate the crystal. It'll send energy pulsing through it, and if my theory is correct it'll cause a reaction with the doorway.

[17:30:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Researcher David] Wait, it's you! What's your name, uh, Sukie, right? Fred's told me about all you've done helping him out with his research, I'm not surprised he's sent you to me.
[17:30:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Researcher David] Where to begin... Ah yes, so- I'm David, a researcher here as you already know. However, I'm not only a researcher, but also a geologist like my wife Nitreia. While she focuses on work in the Ishnir continent, I've been investigating the geology of the Chillwind.
[17:30:41] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [|>>]
[17:30:45] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Researcher David] Years ago, I made a breakthrough discovery while investigating a dig site. The evidence was there that despite all reasoning, the masses of land we know as the Celsian Isles weren't formed naturally. Deep enough underground, samples of rock were closer to that of the ocean floor over anything else, despite the absolute lack of any signs of volcanic activity.
[17:30:45] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [|>>]
[17:30:46] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Researcher David] I had snuck into the dig site while the workers were asleep to collect samples. For reasons unknown to me at the time, they weren't allowed to let anyone in. I know now that they did that because they had uncovered a massive door, and dug around it into an even larger fortress. Carved into the walls were vast drawings of large, humanoid beings- Giants. Within the fortress, I also found documents that referenced these Giants.
[17:30:46] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [|>>]
[17:30:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Researcher David] From these documents, I have reason to believe that a Giant still lives, sleeping beneath the mountains. The documents also mentioned the rivers being the "lifeblood" of the Giants- I think that's good a lead as any. Follow the river east from the dig site and see where it leads. I hope this helps. I wish you luck.

[17:30:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Researcher David] I hope you find what you're looking for. Since you're all caught up now, Fred can tell you what he needs you to do if you haven't figured it out. I have no clue myself, sorry.
[17:30:47] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Could you tell me that story again?]
[17:30:48] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Researcher David] Sure, so: Where to begin... Ah yes, so- I'm David, a researcher here as you already know. However, I'm not only a researcher, but also a geologist like my wife Nitreia. While she focuses on work in the Ishnir continent, I've been investigating the geology of the Chillwind.

[17:30:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Researcher David] Years ago, I made a breakthrough discovery while investigating a dig site. The evidence was there that despite all reasoning, the masses of land we know as the Celsian Isles weren't formed naturally. Deep enough underground, samples of rock were closer to that of the ocean floor over anything else, despite the absolute lack of any signs of volcanic activity.
[17:30:49] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [|>>]
[17:30:50] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Researcher David] I had snuck into the dig site while the workers were asleep to collect samples. For reasons unknown to me at the time, they weren't allowed to let anyone in. I know now that they did that because they had uncovered a massive door, and dug around it into an even larger fortress. Carved into the walls were vast drawings of large, humanoid beings- Giants. Within the fortress, I also found documents that referenced these Giants.
[17:30:50] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [|>>]
[17:30:51] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Researcher David] From these documents, I have reason to believe that a Giant still lives, sleeping beneath the mountains. The documents also mentioned the rivers being the "lifeblood" of the Giants. So, yeah. Let me know you happen to look into this yourself at all, I'd love to know more about what's in that dig site.
[17:30:55] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Stone Ocean: Go to where David was talking about, follow the river to its end and use the D.R.E.A.M. Catcher. Bring it back to Fred when you're done.

[18:17:29] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] I can sense it on you Sukie... that power... Nah, I'm kidding, I'm just assuming you wouldn't come back tracking snow all over the place if you were still empty handed. You didn't, right?
[18:17:29] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I got it, here you go.]
[18:17:29] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [No luck yet.]
[18:17:36] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] Hm, I was expecting something less corporeal. No matter! We have work to do, Sukie! Just tell me when you're ready and we can start the experiment.
[18:17:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Stone Ocean: Return to Fred when you're ready to start up the Stone Fred.

[18:18:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] Are you ready to begin? Say the word and I'll take us to the Stone Fred.
[18:18:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Let's do this!]
[18:18:00] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [I just have a question- what are we doing exactly?]
[18:18:03] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] Isn't it obvious? We're turning the Stone Fred into a doorway! Hopefully, at least. If we could open a stable doorway here, the possibilities it opens up... Let's not get ahead of ourselves here, though.

[18:18:12] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] Okay Sukie, the doorway is open! It appears to be stable, but I don't know how long it will stay that way. You need to enter it quickly! Oh, and try not to die!

[18:18:15] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] The Stone Ocean: The doorway closed and trapped you inside! Find a way out.

[18:18:42] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Fred] Sukie? Can you hear me? Oh, shoot... Sukie, the doorway! It's closing! You have t-
