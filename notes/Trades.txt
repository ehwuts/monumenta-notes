[22:01:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sorrell] I was sent down here by my friend Redd to try and find more information on the Silvered Sight, but got cornered into this little room instead. Can you help me?
[22:01:59] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [With what?]
[22:02:03] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sorrell] Finding the Silvered Sight of course! It's a wonderful little helm, granting the wearer the power to see through even the darkest of nights. I found a dusty tome in those nasty people's library that details how to make one, but I have none of the components.
[22:02:03] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [What do you need?]
[22:02:04] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sorrell] I need Silverblood and a Kismet's Blessing.

[22:02:04] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Where do I get a Kismet's Blessing?]
[22:02:06] [main/INFO]: [CHAT] [Sorrell] Silverblood is the blood of an Enderman infused with 8 silver. Silver is very rare in this valley though, and tends to only be found around absolutely volcanic temperatures. You'll want to find a Crafter somewhere that can combine them!
