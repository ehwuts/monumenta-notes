[18:50:24] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Jeremiah] H-hello, welcome to the Arena of Terth!

[18:50:26] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Jeremiah] This is the Arena of Terth. Back in the day it was the greatest test of skill in the land where warriors from across the world sought to prove their might. Then there were a series of rather unfortunate incidents that led to it being shut down by royal order... But its back now and better than ever!

[18:50:31] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Jeremiah] You... really shouldn't be asking questions like that. He really doesn't like to be bothered. H-he's very busy overseeing the Arena and doesn't need people asking questions about him at all...

[18:50:40] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Jeremiah] Yes, but your inventory must be completely empty. The protective magic that protects you from serious harm in there would destroy anything else you took in!
[18:50:40] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Note: The arena is a spectator sport. Your run will end if you spend more than 30 minutes in the shop (after any one wave) or 40 minutes fighting (any one wave). Logging out is discouraged but allowed as long as you stick to these time periods.

[18:50:55] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Jeremiah] There are two main ways. Y-you could head off into the world and hone your skills elsewhere, or you could try practice mode.
[18:50:55] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Practice mode allows you to play through a single wave of your choosing. Wave practice is available for any wave group that you have reached so far.

==Teal keys==
 [PP] quackqwack_:
Era 1:
Top Temple [the place you get to by going past colosseum]
Tree [The big tree on a floating island, higher than the hub island]
(Proto-)Pedestal [Below the colosseum, you can jump down onto it from the hub island]

Era 2:
Top Temple 
Tree
Ender Temple [Below tree, near the bottom of the map]
Top Houses [The other path leading up from colosseum] 
Pedestal

Era 3: 
Top Temple 
Potion House [Below top temple near the void, the house kind of looks like a potion bottle]
Tree
Upper Palace [In the western wall, there is a complex that sort of reminds me of a palace. One key is at the top]
Lower Palace [and one key is near the bottom.  Just inside from the market stalls]
Top Houses
Water [There are some water tunnels in the eastern wall.  You can enter from the aqueduct in the NE corner, or a waterfall in the SE corner.  There is also a non-descript opening in the middle]

==The Fallen Lore-um==

there are 3 items in the dungeon, one in the spawn room, one in the archive, and one in the growth, that all convert into a different item outside the dungeon, and then each branch (conscriptorium, conservatory, and living quarters) has a place where you upgrade the respective item again

Bottled Spirit - Walk through a bookshelf in spawn room. Put in an item frame in apartment 231 in Sierhaven to get Shade Telemetry. Put in an item frame in a room behind a painting in a room above a trapdoor, in a ceiling in Conscriptorium to get Shadowed Vial.

Arm of an Ent - Growth Labs, walk through the ankh pattern in a wall above a stairwell. Put it in the item frame through the painting in the Lowtide button puzzle room to transform it into Ent Seedling. Put that in turn into the item frame hidden near the end of the righthand path of the Conservatory to turn it into the Wooden Needle.

Letter to a Loved One - Archives, hidden run down quest puzzle room, walk through stone bricks. In one of the dockside Frostgate sublevel rooms is a painting at floor level to walk through, do so and trade with Talisid for Alleria's Locket. Transform into Damaged Chassis in Living Quarters, there's a door behind leaves, if you fall into the area before the spiral stair up.

In the room where bhairavi gives the reward chest, dig under the tree to find a hole. Put the Wooden Needle, Bottled Spirit, and Damaged Chassis into the item frames then step on the plate. The player who stepped on the plate will be awarded the advancement and a Replica Olive Wool.

==Cadwell==
[Cadwell] Ah... Have we met before? You strike me as a fellow connoisseur, a kindred soul! I do hope you'll enjoy the wares my humble bakery has to offer, eh he he he.
[Your wares?]
	[Cadwell] The finest resin to ever grace the Celsian Isles! That is what those knights are still calling it, hm, the Celsian Isles? Here, take one! A free sample for a new friend. It works wonders with the right stones, much like baking a fine cake, neh heh he.
	[What's the recipe?]
		[Cadwell] Oh it's easy, like baking a cake! Haven't you ever baked a cake before? Just take your weapon, surround it the other ingredients, and pop it in the oven!
		[Other ingredients?]
			[Cadwell] Well, what ingredients do you normally put in a cake?
			[Milk.]
				[Cadwell] Milk? On a cake? Preposterous! Perhaps you mean frosting?
				[Cadwell] Anyway, that's your Lime Titanite! Spread it over the blade to sharpen it and make it better at what it does best! It can only be found in very strong monsters, like these two beasties duking it out up there. I've already cleared this one out, but the other should still have some shards ripe for the picking!
			[Wheat.]
				[Cadwell] What kind of magic ovens are you using? You don't cook wheat!
				[Cadwell] The base of this cake is a magical Powder. One of those fiery towns knows how to make it so well it Pulsates!
			[Egg.]
				[Cadwell] Ah yes, the egg, the center of everything, including this cake!
				[Cadwell] That's your weapon, but not just any weapon will do. Only wizards of dark magic wield weapons capable of holding enchantments like this! These ones are so strong that only Mother Nature could forge a scythe capable of handling them!
				[Cadwell] Sugar.
				[Cadwell] That's where my special Pine Resin comes in! That's where the enchantments come from: very important, very sweet, very deadly!
	[How do I ..bake.. this recipe?]
		[Cadwell] Well well well that is a question isn't it? I can't just have you using MY oven! Dragonbone technology, burn your face off, stuff like that. I don't mind it but you fleshies are all so sensitive!
		[Cadwell] I do recall a quaint little village across the ocean. Delightful little place, a bit too humid for my liking, but their chefs were rather talented! They had a box that you put the food into and with the flick of a switch your food is done, no face-burning required!
[This is a bakery?]
	[Cadwell] Well of course! Your eyes must still have some salt water stuck in them. Those _are_ eyes, right? And a nose too. Take a waft! The wonderful odors around us will cleanse any doubts. I would settle on nothing less for my crisp resin!
	[This smells awful! We're in the stomach of a sea serpent, surrounded by corpses!]
		[Cadwell] Yes, isn't it grand? Much better than the islands up above, always too hot or too cold. Just, don't tell the knights, okay? I haven't submitted my insurance yet and I would hate to have them ruin a perfectly good establishment again.
		[Knights? Again?]
			[Cadwell] Oh, I can't count the amount of times those silvered thugs have come barging in. Disrespectful fanatics, the lot are! No taste for true craftsmanship! Someone should put some sense into them... Neh heh he...  Ah, what were we talking about?
			[The... knights?]
